Player 0 has been consistently raising, signaling that they are confident in the strength of their hand. On the other hand, as the game has progressed, Player 1 has shifted from aggressive raises to a more cautionary approach with calls. This behavior indicates that Player 1's hand may not have strengthened as much as they initially expected. However, their strategies might also reflect an attempt at bluffing to sway the game in their favor.\nyour opponent's opinion of you is: In the eyes of my opponents, their perception of my game strategy has likely shifted. Initially, I was regarded as a cautious player based on my early moves in the game. Later, my aggressive strategy may have come as a surprise to them and could prompt them to rethink their assessment of me as a 'tight' player. This shift in my game play might influence their future moves and make them more cautious when deciding on their next strategies.\nAs Player 3, please analyze your own game situation bracketed with <ses> and </ses>, that includes hand and community card types, feasible game strategies, the game situation of opponents who have not chosen to fold bracketed with <ops> and </ops>, that includes opponents' behavior, opponents' possible strategies, and then briefly talk about your opponent's opinion of you bracketed with <opo> and </opo>, and finally give the most reasonable action in the form of '{'action': '...'}'.
