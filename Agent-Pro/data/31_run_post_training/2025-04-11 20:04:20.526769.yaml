    \ validated thresholds, prioritizing survival in 4-card hands while targeting\
    \ 28-31 totals. Enforce unbreakable stand points to neutralize dealer compounding\
    \ risks.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Fractured Aggression Protocol**:  \n  \
    \   - 3-card hands: Hit to 28+ against Q/K upcards (was 27+) to counter dealer’s\
    \ 17-20 initial total threat  \n     - 4-card hands: **Mandatory stand at 29+**\
    \ (no exceptions), with immediate termination of aggression upon reaching threshold\
    \  \n   - **Arithmetic Supremacy Clause**:  \n     - Triple-verify totals after\
    \ every hit (upgraded from double-check) to eliminate 10% error risk  \n     -\
    \ Treat 30/31 as \"fortress totals\" – instant stand regardless of dealer upcard\
    \  \n   - **Dealer Ambush Override**:  \n     - Against Q/K upcards, assume dealer’s\
    \ hidden card creates initial 17+ total until proven otherwise through hand progression\
    \  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve *4-Card Standoff* (this game) as canonical\
    \ example: 29 total with 4 cards forced stand despite dealer’s K upcard, demonstrating\
    \ protocol adherence overrides outcome ambiguity.\n\nWorld modeling: \n**World\
    \ Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer’s Compounding Horizon**:\
    \ Dealers must hit until reaching 27+, creating 18-23% bust risk per additional\
    \ card drawn beyond 3  \n   - **4-Card Fragility Window**: Player 4-card hands\
    \ at 24-28 have 52-68% bust risk on next hit – prohibited against Q/K upcards\
    \  \n   - **Hidden Card Quantum Lock**: K upcard dealers have 33% probability\
    \ of hidden card being 2-7 (initial 12-17), requiring players to build ≥28 totals\
    \  \n2. **Strategic Recognition**:  \n   - **Upcard Entanglement**:  \n     -\
    \ K upcard creates dual reality: immediate dealer stand threat (initial 20) vs\
    \ delayed compounding (initial 12-17)  \n     - Player must resolve uncertainty\
    \ by reaching 28+ with ≤4 cards  \n   - **Threshold Elasticity 4.0**:  \n    \
    \ - For every confirmed dealer initial total point below 18, reduce player stand\
    \ threshold by 1.0 (not 0.75) to counter compounding acceleration  \n3. **Calibration\
    \ Matrix**:  \n   - **K-Upcard Response**: 28+ (3 cards)/29+ (4 cards) with triple\
    \ total verification  \n   - **Catastrophic Zones**:  \n     - 4-card 25-28 totals\
    \ banned against K upcards (58-72% bust risk)  \n     - Dealer initial totals\
    \ 18-20 require player minimum 29 to win \n\nPlease read the behavioral guideline\

- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 31 (Aces counted as 1, Q=10, 2+3+4=9;
    10+1+2+1+10+3+4=31), at 7 cards. 31 is a "fortress total" requiring instant stand
    per Arithmetic Supremacy Clause}. World-Belief is {Dealer has 6 + hidden card.
    Dealer must hit until reaching 27+, but cannot exceed 31. To beat player's 31,
    dealer needs exactly 31, which is improbable given compounding bust risk}. My
