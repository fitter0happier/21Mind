    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game. Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 31 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 31, he or she loses the game.\

    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\
