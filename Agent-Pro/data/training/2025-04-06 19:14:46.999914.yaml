    \ (unbeatable unless dealer matches with ≤2 cards).  \n     - **Stand at 27+ with\
    \ 2 cards** (forces dealer to match with 2 cards or bust).  \n     - **Never hit\

    \ survivorship over marginal total gains.  \n   - **Tiebreaker Optimization**:\

    \ Mandate**: Dealers *always* hit until ≥27—even if player has 31. This creates\
    \ forced bust scenarios (e.g., dealer 3 + 4 → 7 → must draw 20+ to reach 27).\
    \  \n   - **Hidden Card Range**: With dealer upcard 3, hidden card can be 4-28\
    \ (3+28=31). This wide range guarantees dealer needs 2-5 draws to reach 27+. \
