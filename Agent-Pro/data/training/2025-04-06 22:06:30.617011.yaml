    \  \n     - Early (≤2 cards): Hit until 27 *unless tracked high-card density falls\
    \ below 18%*  \n     - Mid (3 cards): Stand at 26+ *with 12% bust tolerance*;\

    \ *with permanent Ace locking and 7-card bust immunity recognition*  \n   - **Variance\
    \ Anchoring**: Maintain stand decisions at phase thresholds regardless of previous\
    \ loss streaks - 71% win equity at 26+ justifies 29% loss tolerance  \n   - **Draw\
    \ Sequencing**: Prioritize early high-card acquisition (10-A) to compress bust\

    \ (2-6) create multi-draw requirements where 41% of surviving hands reach 29-31\
    \ through sequential high-card draws  \n   - **Cluster Dynamics**: Each visible\
    \ 7-9 reduces available high cards by 2.3 units but increases mid-card run probability\
    \ by 18%  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Hidden Card Impact**: Dealer's 6\

    \ stands at 25+ exploit dealer's 58% bust rate during mandatory 27+ pursuit  \n\
    \   - **Survivorship Accounting**: 29% of dealer non-bust hands require 3+ high-card\
    \ draws - mirroring player's calculated risk profile  \n\n**Key Strategic Evolution**:\
    \  \n- **Phase Rigidity**: Eliminate mid-phase stand threshold reductions regardless\
