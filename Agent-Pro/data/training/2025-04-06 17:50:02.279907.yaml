    \ totals in the 27-30 range where feasible, balancing bust risk against the dealer’s\
    \ capacity to reach 27+ via incremental draws. Prioritize totals that force the\
    \ dealer into high-bust-probability single draws rather than multi-draw safety.\
    \  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Stand on 27+** regardless of dealer’s visible\
    \ card (revised upward from 25+).  \n   - **Hit on ≤26** unless dealer’s visible\
    \ card is ≤6 (indicating their hidden card likely creates a low starting total,\
    \ making multi-draw survival harder).  \n   - **Aggression calibration**: When\
    \ dealer shows 7-10, assume their hidden card could be low; aim for 27+ to counteract\

    World modeling: **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - Dealers with\
    \ **visible high cards (8-10)** often pair with low hidden cards, enabling incremental\
    \ draws (e.g., J+2 → 12 → 22 → 28). This reduces bust risk compared to needing\
    \ a single large draw.  \n   - **Low dealer starting totals (e.g., 12-16)** allow\
    \ dealers to \"grind\" to 27+ via multiple small cards (e.g., 12 → 22 → 28), bypassing\
    \ single-draw bust thresholds.  \n   - **Player totals of 27-30** are safer against\
    \ dealer’s multi-draw paths but require precise risk-taking (e.g., hitting 26\
    \ for a 2-5).  \n\n**Policy Update**  \n- **Previous Guideline**: \"Stand at 25+\"\
