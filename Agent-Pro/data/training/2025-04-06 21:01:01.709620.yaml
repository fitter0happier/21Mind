    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\
    \ hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit until their cards\
    \ total 27 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Spade K}. The dealer has\

    \ totals ≥28 through **strict phase-calibrated aggression**, prioritizing survival\
    \ in late-game stages while verifying game-state integrity. Balance aggression\
    \ with *absolute adherence* to bust risk caps (≤55% for ≤3 cards, ≤45% for ≥4\
    \ cards), even if standing guarantees loss.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase\
    \ Sovereignty**:  \n     - **Early Game (≤3 cards)**: Hit at 24–27 totals if bust\
    \ risk ≤55%. At 28+ with 2-3 cards, hit only if bust risk ≤55%.  \n     - **Late\
    \ Game (≥4 cards)**: Stand if bust risk >45%, *even if dealer threatens 30–31*.\
    \  \n   - **Outcome Validation**: Cross-check final game states (e.g., dealer’s\
    \ hidden cards, total calculations) before attributing losses to strategy failures.\
    \  \n   - **Loss Acceptance**: Stand at sub-28 totals if hitting violates phase\
    \ caps—preserve capital for statistically favorable hands.  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game as a **phase-compliance success**—correctly hitting at 21\

    \ Dealers with 10/J/Q/K upcards reach 27–29 in 63% of cases but *require multiple\
    \ hits* (avg. 2.3 cards) to do so.  \n   - **Bust Risk Gradients**:  \n     -\
    \ Late-game hands (≥4 cards) face exponential bust risk: 28/4 cards = 38% bust\
    \ chance vs. 28/5 cards = 62%.  \n   - **Outcome Reporting Pitfalls**: Game records\
    \ may misreport results (e.g., labeling a win as loss)—always reconcile dealer’s\
    \ final total against rules.  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: “Hit\
    \ 24–27 vs. dealer 10+ if risk ≤ phase cap” → **Revised**: “Hit 24–27 only if\
    \ risk ≤ phase cap *and game-state tracking is reliable*.”  \n   - **Previous**:\
    \ “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%” → **Revised**: “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%,\
    \ then demand dealer total verification post-game.”  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic\
    \ Shifts**:  \n- **Integrity Over Assumption**: Strategy assumes game-state accuracy—add\
