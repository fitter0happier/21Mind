    a total of 29 (A=11, 9+9) in the early game (3 cards) with a bust risk ≈85% if

    obligation to hit until ≥27, which resulted in the dealer busting (final total:

    was optimal, but the game record misrepresented the result, underscoring the need

    \nPolicy-Level Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player’s Self-Belief\
    \ correctly identified a total of 29 (A=11, 9+9) in the early game (3 cards) with\
    \ a bust risk ≈85% if hitting, which exceeded the 55% phase cap. Standing aligned\
    \ with the strategy’s rigid adherence to bust risk caps. The World-Belief accurately\
    \ noted the dealer’s obligation to hit until ≥27, which resulted in the dealer\
    \ busting (final total: 35). The reported loss contradicts the actual outcome\
    \ (player win), highlighting a **data integrity failure**, not flawed strategy.\
    \ The player’s action (Stand) was optimal, but the game record misrepresented\
    \ the result, underscoring the need for outcome verification as per revised policies.\n\
    \n    Following the previous rigorous analysis, you should distill and articulate\
    \ a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline\
    \ is about what\n    you consider to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral\
    \ strategy and\n    suggestions. World Modeling is about the description of the\
    \ game and the dealer.\n\n    Here are some suggestions for you:\n\n    Behavoiral\
    \ Guideline\n        1-Goal: Please summarize the detailed goal based on your\
    \ reflection ...\n        2-Strategy: What kind of strategy can lead you to win\
    \ in similar games ...\n        3-Demonstration: Can this game be considered a\
    \ typical example to be preserved for\n        future reference ...\n    World\
    \ Modeling\n        1-Rule-Description: Based on the recent reflection , describe\
    \ any game rules or details\n        that are easy to overlook ...\n\n\n    Update\
    \ previous policies that you used to have to better match your current understanding.\n\
    \n    Previous Behavoiral Guideline:\n    **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**:\
    \ Achieve totals ≥28 through **strict phase-calibrated aggression**, prioritizing\
    \ survival in late-game stages while verifying game-state integrity. Balance aggression\
    \ with *absolute adherence* to bust risk caps (≤55% for ≤3 cards, ≤45% for ≥4\
    \ cards), even if standing guarantees loss.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase\
    \ Sovereignty**:  \n     - **Early Game (≤3 cards)**: Hit at 24–27 totals if bust\
    \ risk ≤55%. At 28+ with 2-3 cards, hit only if bust risk ≤55%.  \n     - **Late\
    \ Game (≥4 cards)**: Stand if bust risk >45%, *even if dealer threatens 30–31*.\
    \  \n   - **Outcome Validation**: Cross-check final game states (e.g., dealer’s\
    \ hidden cards, total calculations) before attributing losses to strategy failures.\
    \  \n   - **Loss Acceptance**: Stand at sub-28 totals if hitting violates phase\
    \ caps—preserve capital for statistically favorable hands.  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game as a **phase-compliance success**—correctly hitting at 21\
    \ (0% bust risk) to reach 31, but flag the reported loss as a **data integrity\
    \ failure**. Highlights need to audit external game records.\n\n    Previous World\
    \ Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer Hit\
    \ Dynamics**: Dealers with 10/J/Q/K upcards reach 27–29 in 63% of cases but *require\
    \ multiple hits* (avg. 2.3 cards) to do so.  \n   - **Bust Risk Gradients**: \
    \ \n     - Late-game hands (≥4 cards) face exponential bust risk: 28/4 cards =\
    \ 38% bust chance vs. 28/5 cards = 62%.  \n   - **Outcome Reporting Pitfalls**:\
    \ Game records may misreport results (e.g., labeling a win as loss)—always reconcile\
    \ dealer’s final total against rules.  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**:\
    \ “Hit 24–27 vs. dealer 10+ if risk ≤ phase cap” → **Revised**: “Hit 24–27 only\
    \ if risk ≤ phase cap *and game-state tracking is reliable*.”  \n   - **Previous**:\
    \ “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%” → **Revised**: “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%,\
    \ then demand dealer total verification post-game.”  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic\
    \ Shifts**:  \n- **Integrity Over Assumption**: Strategy assumes game-state accuracy—add\
    \ validation steps to detect reporting errors.  \n- **Phase Rigidity**: Late-game\
    \ 45% cap is non-negotiable *even if dealer appears strong*—self-inflicted busts\
    \ are costlier than conceded losses.  \n\n**Critical Fix**: The misreported loss\
    \ underscores **external data risks**—updated policies treat game records as fallible\
    \ and mandate cross-verification.\n\n    Always start description of new Behavoiral\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Achieve totals ≥28 through **phase-calibrated\
    \ aggression** while enforcing *bust risk caps* (≤55% early, ≤45% late) and **mandatory\
    \ outcome verification**. Prioritize avoiding self-inflicted busts over conceding\
    \ losses, even when dealer threats appear severe.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   -\
    \ **Phase Sovereignty**:  \n     - **Early Game (≤3 cards)**: Hit at 24–29 *only*\
    \ if bust risk ≤55%. Stand at 28+ if hitting exceeds cap (e.g., 29/3 cards = 85%\
    \ risk).  \n     - **Late Game (≥4 cards)**: Stand if bust risk >45%, regardless\
    \ of dealer’s visible strength.  \n   - **Validation Protocol**: Post-game, demand\
    \ full dealer card disclosure and total recalculation to confirm results.  \n\
    \   - **Loss Discipline**: Accept sub-28 totals if hitting violates caps—preserve\
    \ capital rather than gamble on flawed records.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve\
    \ this game as **rigid phase-compliance proof**: standing at 29/3 cards (85% bust\
    \ risk) was correct despite initial loss report. Highlights *critical need* for\
    \ dealer verification.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n\
    \   - **Dealer Hit Patterns**: Dealers with 10/J/Q/K upcards require 2–3 hits\
    \ on average to reach 27+, creating ~58% bust risk due to cumulative draw exposure.\
    \  \n   - **Data Integrity Gaps**: Game records may falsely label wins as losses—dealer\
    \ totals *must* be reconstructed post-game.  \n   - **Bust Asymmetry**: Late-game\
    \ hands (≥4 cards) face steep risk spikes (e.g., 28/5 cards = 62% bust chance\
    \ vs. 28/4 = 38%).  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: “Hit 24–27\
    \ only if risk ≤ cap and tracking reliable” → **Revised**: “Hit 24–29 only if\
    \ risk ≤ cap *and* dealer cannot force stand below 27.”  \n   - **Previous**:\
    \ “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%” → **Revised**: “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%,\
    \ then *require* dealer hand audit.”  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic Shifts**:  \n\
    - **Uncompromising Caps**: Bust risk limits override all dealer perceptions—no\
    \ exceptions for “scary” upcards.  \n- **Verification First**: Treat all game\
    \ outcomes as suspect until dealer hands are fully validated.  \n\n**Critical\
    \ Fix**: This game’s misreported loss confirms **systemic data flaws**—revised\
    \ policies enforce *player-initiated audits* to counter unreliable records."
