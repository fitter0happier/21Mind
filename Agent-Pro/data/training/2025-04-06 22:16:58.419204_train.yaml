    the dealer’s confirmed bust (36 > 31). The **Self-Belief** was consistent (correct
    phase thresholds, no Aces), and **World-Belief** accurately predicted dealer bust
    risk. The contradiction lies in the game record’s incorrect labeling of the outcome,
    not the strategy. The player’s logic was sound, but external data inconsistency

    \ Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player’s actions aligned with\
    \ the aggressive strategy (hitting at 12 → 22 → 30) and correctly stood at 30\
    \ under late-phase rules. However, the final result mistakenly labels this as\
    \ a loss despite the dealer’s confirmed bust (36 > 31). The **Self-Belief** was\
    \ consistent (correct phase thresholds, no Aces), and **World-Belief** accurately\
    \ predicted dealer bust risk. The contradiction lies in the game record’s incorrect\
    \ labeling of the outcome, not the strategy. The player’s logic was sound, but\
    \ external data inconsistency misrepresents the loss. Key issue: System error\
    \ in recording dealer’s total (36 → bust) as a loss instead of a win, violating\
    \ Rule 2.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous analysis, you should distill\
