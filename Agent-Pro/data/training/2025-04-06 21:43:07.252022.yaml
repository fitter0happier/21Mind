    \ (3 cards): Hit only if bust risk ≤20% *and* total ≤24 *or* dealer visible ≤6.\

    \ ≥25 unless dealer visible ≤4 *and* high-card density >25%.  \n   - **Bust Risk\
    \ Refinement**:  \n     - For 3-card hands: Bust risk = (remaining 8+/A cards\
    \ ÷ total remaining) × 2.0 (emphasizes 8+ as critical threats).  \n     - Auto-stand\
    \ if mid-phase total ≥26 *and* dealer visible ≥10 (blocks over-reliance on incremental\

    \ **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer Mid-Range Optimization**:\
    \ Dealers with hidden 7-9 (total 17-19) can safely hit toward 27-30 with ≤35%\
    \ bust risk per draw, invalidating prior \"high incremental bust\" assumptions.\
    \  \n   - **High-Card Clustering**: Every visible 10/J/Q/K/A increases dealer\
    \ survival odds by 8% when their hidden card is 7-9 (due to reduced bust likelihood\
    \ on 17-19 totals).  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: Simulate dealer\
    \ paths for hidden 8-10/A → **Revised**: \"Model hidden 7-10/A when dealer visible\
    \ ≥9, weighting 7-9 as 60% probable.\"  \n   - **Previous**: Stand at ≥23 vs visible\

    \ Acknowledge dealers frequently reach 27-30 via hidden 7-9, demanding higher\
    \ player totals (≥27) when dealer visible ≥10.  \n- **Cluster-Aware Bust Calculus**:\
    \ Penalize decks with ≥4 visible high cards by inflating bust risk multipliers\
