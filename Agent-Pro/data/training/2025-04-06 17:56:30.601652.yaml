    \ hitting at 26+ unless dealer’s visible card indicates *certain* multi-draw requirements\
    \ (e.g., dealer shows 2-3).  \n   - **Aggression Calibration**: At 24-26, weigh\
    \ remaining deck composition—prefer standing if ≥40% of remaining cards would\

    ---\nWorld modeling: **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Immediate\

    \ \"Stand at 26+ against dealer 7-10; hit 25-26 only with 2-card hands and favorable\
