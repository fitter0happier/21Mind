    totals. The dealer’s hidden 2 forced multiple draws (J+2 → 12 → hit → 22 → hit
    → 28), revealing a flaw in the assumption that mid-range stands (26) always pressure
    dealers to bust. The dealer’s mandatory hitting rule allowed them to survive low-risk
    incremental draws (10 then 6) rather than high-risk big cards. The loss stemmed
    from overestimating dealer bust probability when their hidden card creates multi-draw
    opportunities below immediate bust thresholds. The core issue is that the "stand-at-25+"

    progression to 27-31.'

    \ where feasible, balancing bust risk against the dealer’s capacity to reach 27+\
    \ via incremental draws. Prioritize totals that force the dealer into high-bust-probability\
    \ single draws rather than multi-draw safety.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Stand\
    \ on 27+** regardless of dealer’s visible card (revised upward from 25+).  \n\
    \   - **Hit on ≤26** unless dealer’s visible card is ≤6 (indicating their hidden\
    \ card likely creates a low starting total, making multi-draw survival harder).\
    \  \n   - **Aggression calibration**: When dealer shows 7-10, assume their hidden\
    \ card could be low; aim for 27+ to counteract their multi-draw potential.  \n\
    3. **Demonstration**: Archive this game to illustrate the danger of mid-range\
    \ stands (25-26) against dealers with high visible cards. Demonstrates the need\
    \ for adaptive thresholds based on visible card context.  \n\n**World Modeling**\
    \  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - Dealers with **visible high cards (8-10)**\
    \ often pair with low hidden cards, enabling incremental draws (e.g., J+2 → 12\
    \ → 22 → 28). This reduces bust risk compared to needing a single large draw.\
    \  \n   - **Low dealer starting totals (e.g., 12-16)** allow dealers to \"grind\"\
    \ to 27+ via multiple small cards (e.g., 12 → 22 → 28), bypassing single-draw\
    \ bust thresholds.  \n   - **Player totals of 27-30** are safer against dealer’s\
    \ multi-draw paths but require precise risk-taking (e.g., hitting 26 for a 2-5).\
    \  \n\n**Policy Update**  \n- **Previous Guideline**: \"Stand at 25+\" → **Revised**:\
    \ \"Stand at 27+ against high dealer cards (7-10); stand at 25+ against low dealer\
    \ cards (2-6).\"  \n- **Previous World Model**: Overlooked dealer’s multi-draw\
    \ paths → **Revised**: Explicitly model dealer’s ability to \"climb\" to 27+ with\
    \ low hidden cards, reducing bust likelihood."
