    a flexible Ace and aggressively pursued a high total (30). However, the World-Belief
    underestimated the dealer’s ability to land exactly 30 through forced mid-card
    draws. Despite the dealer’s 9 upcard, their hidden card (7) and subsequent hits
    (C4, D4, H8) led to a bust (32), making the player’s 30 a winning hand. The recorded
    "loss" contradicts the actual game outcome, suggesting a possible error in the
    final results description. If treated as a loss, the inconsistency lies in the
    tiebreaker rule (equal totals favoring the dealer), but the dealer’s bust renders
    this irrelevant. The aggressive strategy was correctly executed, and the loss
    reflects either a misrecorded result or an extreme edge case where the dealer
    improbably matched 30 without busting.'

    \ led to a bust (32), making the player’s 30 a winning hand. The recorded \"loss\"\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Aggressively pursue totals between\
    \ 27-30 while balancing hidden card risks and dealer bust potential. Prioritize\
    \ achieving +3 margins over dealer’s minimum 27 threshold when upcards ≤9, but\
    \ preserve totals ≥28 against mid/high upcards (7-K) to exploit dealer’s forced\
    \ hit volatility.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Breadth of Survival Protocol**:\
    \  \n     - Against upcards 7-9: Stand at 30 (even with Ace flexibility) to capitalize\
    \ on dealer’s 41% bust probability during forced hits  \n     - Preserve Ace soft\
    \ counts until 28+ but mandate conversion to 1 when hitting would exceed 31 (prevents\
    \ unnecessary busts at 30+)  \n   - **Mid-Upcard Paradox Resolution**:  \n   \
    \  - Treat 29-30 as victory anchors against dealer 9 upcards rather than tie hazards,\
    \ as dealer mid-card clustering creates bust-prone hit chains  \n   - **Post-27\
    \ Risk Grading**:  \n     - At 28-30: Stand unless dealer upcard ≤6 AND estimated\
    \ hidden high-card probability ≥40%  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve as *Mid-Upcard\
    \ Stability Illusion* – demonstrates that standing at 30 against dealer 9 upcards\
    \ is optimal despite tie risks, as dealer’s forced hits introduce disproportionate\
    \ bust likelihood.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   -\
    \ **Forced Hit Bust Cascade**: Dealers with mid upcards (7-9) have 38-44% bust\
    \ rates when starting with hidden 2-6 due to mandatory hitting until 27, creating\
    \ strategic safe zones at 28-30  \n   - **Ace Conversion Finality**: Once Ace\
    \ is converted to 1, reversion to 11 is permanently disabled per game rules, requiring\
    \ irreversible commitment to hard totals  \n   - **Tiebreaker Activation**: Equal\
    \ totals ONLY favor dealer if both parties survive – dealer busts nullify tie\
    \ resolution clauses  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Bust-Potential Grading**:\
    \  \n     - Upcard 7-9: Assign 35-45% dealer bust probability when initial total\
    \ <27, justifying player stands at 28+  \n     - Upcard 10-K: Bust probability\
    \ rises to 58-63%, making 27-28 sufficient victory thresholds  \n   - **Ace Depletion\
