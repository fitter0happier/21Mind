    at 25/3 vs. dealer J-upcard) strictly followed the guidelines, which prioritize
    avoiding 4+ cards and locking in 22+ totals. However, the loss occurred due to
    **structural inefficiency in tiebreakers**, not flawed strategy. The dealer’s
    hidden card (H6) gave them an initial total of 16 (J+6), forcing them to hit until
    reaching 27. Despite drawing multiple low cards and Aces (counted as 1 to avoid
    busting), the dealer eventually reached 27+ with 3+ cards. The rules likely favored
    the dealer’s hand due to card-count tiebreakers (e.g., 27/3 vs. 25/3). The player’s
    **correct adherence to guidelines** could not overcome the dealer’s forced draw
    advantage, highlighting the inherent risk of mid-range 3-card hands against strong
    dealer upcards. The final cards’ listing inconsistency (dealer’s apparent bust)
    suggests potential data errors, but the core strategic logic remains valid.'

    \ The player's Self-Belief and action (Stand at 25/3 vs. dealer J-upcard) strictly\
    \ followed the guidelines, which prioritize avoiding 4+ cards and locking in 22+\
    \ totals. However, the loss occurred due to **structural inefficiency in tiebreakers**,\
    \ not flawed strategy. The dealer’s hidden card (H6) gave them an initial total\
    \ of 16 (J+6), forcing them to hit until reaching 27. Despite drawing multiple\
    \ low cards and Aces (counted as 1 to avoid busting), the dealer eventually reached\
    \ 27+ with 3+ cards. The rules likely favored the dealer’s hand due to card-count\
    \ tiebreakers (e.g., 27/3 vs. 25/3). The player’s **correct adherence to guidelines**\
    \ could not overcome the dealer’s forced draw advantage, highlighting the inherent\
    \ risk of mid-range 3-card hands against strong dealer upcards. The final cards’\
    \ listing inconsistency (dealer’s apparent bust) suggests potential data errors,\
    \ but the core strategic logic remains valid.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous\
    \ analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines\
    \ and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you consider\
    \ to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral strategy and\n    suggestions.\
    \ World Modeling is about the description of the game and the dealer.\n\n    Here\

    \ match your current understanding.\n\n    Previous Behavoiral Guideline:\n  \
    \  **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Maximize survivorship *and structural\
    \ efficiency* by prioritizing totals ≥27 with ≤2 cards, while aggressively avoiding\
    \ 4+ card hands. Sacrifice marginal total gains (e.g., 30/4) to preserve card-count\
    \ advantages.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Stand Thresholds**:  \n     - **31\
    \ always stands** (even with 4+ cards).  \n     - **Stand at 24+ with 3 cards**\
    \ (prevents 4-card bust cascades; e.g., 24/3 → hitting risks 50%+ bust chance).\
    \  \n     - **Stand at 22+ vs. dealer 10/J/Q/K upcards** (dealer likely reaches\
    \ 27+ with 2-3 cards; prioritize survivorship over chasing).  \n   - **Aggression\
    \ Limits**:  \n     - Chase 31 **only** with soft hands *and* dealer upcard ≤6.\
    \  \n     - Treat 3-card hands as **semi-rigid**: Hit only if total ≤20 *and*\
    \ dealer upcard ≤6.  \n   - **Tiebreaker Optimization**:  \n     - Actively avoid\
    \ 3+ card hands when dealer’s upcard ≥7 (dealer’s high starting total reduces\
    \ their need for multi-card draws).  \n3. **Demonstration**: This game exemplifies\
    \ **over-aggression with mid-range 3-card hands**—preserve to enforce:  \n   -\
    \ **23/3 vs. Q-upcard → mandatory stand** (bust risk >40%, tiebreaker loss likely).\
    \  \n   - **Q-upcard dominance**: Dealers with 10-face upcards frequently reach\
    \ 27+ with 2-3 cards, rendering player 4-card hands structurally inferior.  \n\
    \n---\n\n    Previous World Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Dealer 10-Upcard Bias**: With Q (10) visible, dealer’s hidden card\
    \ has **~40% probability of 7-10** (total 17-20). This lets them reach 27+ in\
    \ 1-2 draws (e.g., hidden 8 → 18 → hit 9 → 27/3).  \n   - **Forced Bust Dynamics**:\
    \ Dealers *must* hit into potential busts (e.g., Q+2=12 → needs 15+ to reach 27,\
    \ high bust risk), but 10-upcards reduce this likelihood.  \n   - **Tiebreaker\
    \ Fallacy**: Rules may ignore card counts, making 27/4 vs. 27/3 a loss. Assume\
    \ ties favor the dealer.  \n\n**Policy Updates**:  \n- **Previous**: “Stand at\
    \ 27+ with 2 cards” → **Revised**: “Stand at **25+ with 2 cards** vs. dealer 10-upcard”\
    \ (preemptively secure structural advantage).  \n- **Previous**: Flexible 3-card\
    \ hits → **Revised**: “**3-card hands ≥22 always stand** vs. dealer 10/J/Q/K”.\
    \  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic Shift**:  \nAggression must now **stratify by dealer\
    \ upcard strength**:  \n- **Dealer ≤6**: Exploit their high bust risk by chasing\

    \ alongside survivorship by prioritizing totals ≥27 with ≤2 cards *or* ≥24 with\
    \ 3 cards when facing dealer 10/J/Q/K upcards. Sacrifice marginal total gains\

    \  \n   - **Stand Thresholds**:  \n     - **3-card hands**: Stand at ≥22 vs. dealer\
    \ 7-9 upcards, **≥24** vs. dealer 10/J/Q/K (addresses tiebreaker vulnerability).\
    \  \n     - **2-card hands**: Stand at ≥25 vs. dealer 10-upcards (preemptively\
