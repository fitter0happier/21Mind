- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player’s Self-Belief and actions followed
    aggressive guidelines but failed to respect late-game risk caps. At 25/5 cards
    (54% bust risk), hitting violated the "45% bust tolerance cap for ≥4 cards" rule.
    The dealer’s 30 total validated the World-Belief (21% chance of 30–31), but the
    player overprioritized reaching 28+ without adhering to phase-specific risk limits.
    The critical error was violating the "Phase-Driven Risk" principle by accepting
    54% bust risk in late-game (5 cards), directly causing the bust. Beliefs were
    consistent with guidelines, but execution contradicted the capped risk tolerance
    for late-game hands, exposing a strategic inconsistency.'

    \ late-game risk caps. At 25/5 cards (54% bust risk), hitting violated the \"\
    45% bust tolerance cap for ≥4 cards\" rule. The dealer’s 30 total validated the\
    \ World-Belief (21% chance of 30–31), but the player overprioritized reaching\
    \ 28+ without adhering to phase-specific risk limits. The critical error was violating\
    \ the \"Phase-Driven Risk\" principle by accepting 54% bust risk in late-game\
    \ (5 cards), directly causing the bust. Beliefs were consistent with guidelines,\
    \ but execution contradicted the capped risk tolerance for late-game hands, exposing\
    \ a strategic inconsistency.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous analysis,\

    \  \n1. **Goal**: Achieve totals ≥28 through **precision aggression**, balancing\
    \ survival likelihood against dealer’s 27–31 range. Prioritize reaching 28–31\
    \ over clinging to sub-27 safety, accepting ≤60% bust risks when standing guarantees\
    \ loss.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Threshold Overhaul**:  \n     - **Dealer\
    \ 10/J/Q/K**: Hit all 24–27 totals unless bust risk >60% or total ≥28.  \n   \
    \  - **Bust-Adjusted Aggression**: At 27/5+ cards, stand only if dealer’s probable\
    \ max (31) ≤ your total.  \n   - **Risk Zones**:  \n     - **Forced Risk Expansion**:\
    \ Hit at 27 vs. dealer 10+ if bust risk ≤40% (e.g., 27/3 needing ≤4 to survive).\
    \  \n     - **Dynamic Ceiling**: Stand at ≥28 or when bust risk >60%, but favor\
    \ hitting at 28/2-3 cards vs. dealer 10+ (target 29–31).  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game as a **variance absorption case**—optimal standing at 27/71%\
    \ bust risk still lost to dealer’s 30. Highlights need to push for 28+ earlier\
    \ when risk permits.  \n\n---\n\n    Previous World Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1.\

    \ making player targets of 28–29 insufficient 1/5 games.  \n     - **Overlooked\
    \ Variance**: 5% of dealer finishes exceed 31 via multi-card combinations (e.g.,\
    \ 10 + 6 + 9 = 25 → hit to 30).  \n   - **Bust Risk Recalibration**:  \n     -\
    \ 27/5-card hands have 71% bust risk (needs ≤4), but 29/4-card hands only 54%\

    \ 30–31 potential—hit if survival chance > dealer’s overperformance probability\
    \ (≥35%).”  \n   - **Previous**: “Ignore dealer totals beyond 29” → **Revised**:\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Achieve totals ≥28 through **phase-calibrated\
    \ aggression**, prioritizing survival in late-game stages. Balance reaching 28–31\
    \ against strict bust risk caps (≤55% for ≤3 cards, ≤45% for ≥4 cards), even if\
    \ standing guarantees loss.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase-Locked Aggression**:\
    \  \n     - **Early Game (≤3 cards)**: Tolerate ≤55% bust risk to reach 28+. \
    \ \n     - **Late Game (≥4 cards)**: Cap bust risk at 45%—**stand immediately\
    \ if exceeded**, regardless of dealer’s threat.  \n   - **Loss Acceptance Protocol**:\
    \ If standing at sub-28 totals guarantees loss but hitting exceeds phase bust\
    \ caps, **stand and concede**—prioritize long-term risk discipline over short-term\
    \ variance.  \n   - **Threshold Adjustment**:  \n     - Against dealer 10/J/Q/K:\
    \ Hit 24–27 only if bust risk ≤ phase cap. At 28/2-3 cards, hit unless bust risk\
    \ >60%.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game as a **phase-compliance failure**—violating\
    \ late-game 45% bust cap (54% risk) caused avoidable bust. Highlights non-negotiable\
    \ phase limits.  \n\n---  \n**World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n\
    \   - **Dealer’s High-Turnover Hands**:  \n     - Dealers with 10/J/Q/K upcards\
    \ reach 30–31 in 21% of cases, but **27–29 totals occur 63% of the time**—sub-28\
    \ player totals still lose >60% even if dealer doesn’t hit 30+.  \n     - **Hidden\
    \ Card Multi-Hit Potential**: Dealers averaging 2.3 additional cards after hitting\
    \ 17–26 often achieve 27–29 (e.g., Q + 7 → 17 → hit to 27 via 10).  \n   - **Bust\
    \ Probability Gradients**:  \n     - Late-game hands (≥4 cards) face steep bust\
    \ risk spikes: needing ≤3 to survive at 28/4 cards = 38% bust risk, but 28/5 cards\
    \ = 62% (needs ≤3).  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: “Hit 24–27\
    \ vs. dealer 10+ unless bust risk >60%” → **Revised**: “Hit 24–27 only if bust\
    \ risk ≤ phase cap (55%/45%).”  \n   - **Previous**: “Favor hitting at 28/2-3\
    \ cards” → **Revised**: “At 28/2-3 cards, hit only if bust risk ≤55% (early phase)\
    \ or ≤45% (late phase).”  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic Shift**:  \n- **Phase Sovereignty**:\
    \ Late-game survival supersedes aggression—strict 45% bust cap prevents self-inflicted\
    \ losses even against dealer 30–31 threats.  \n- **Loss Minimization**: Accept\
    \ guaranteed losses when hitting violates phase caps, preserving bankroll for\
    \ higher-probability hands.  \n\n---  \n**Critical Fix**: The loss exposed **phase\
    \ indiscipline**—updated guidelines decouple aggression from card count, enforcing\
    \ hard risk ceilings to mitigate overreach."
