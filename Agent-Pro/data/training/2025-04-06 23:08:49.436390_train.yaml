    identified their total (31, no bust risk) and adhered to the guideline to stand
    once the target threshold was achieved. The **World-Belief** accurately noted
    the dealer’s obligation to hit until ≥27, with their final total being 30 (6+7+7+10).
    However, the stated "losing game" contradicts the actual result (player 31 vs.
    dealer 30 = win). The inconsistency lies in the mislabeled outcome, not the strategy.
    The player’s actions were optimal: hitting to 31 (exploiting Ace elasticity) and
    standing maximized survival while beating the dealer. The loss likely stems from
    a recording error, as the logic and math confirm a player victory. The underlying
    issue is external data misalignment, not flawed reasoning.'

    \ '\n  final results: win.\n\nPolicy-Level Reflection: I analyze this game as\
    \ follows: The player’s **Self-Belief** correctly identified their total (31,\
    \ no bust risk) and adhered to the guideline to stand once the target threshold\
    \ was achieved. The **World-Belief** accurately noted the dealer’s obligation\
    \ to hit until ≥27, with their final total being 30 (6+7+7+10). However, the stated\
    \ \"losing game\" contradicts the actual result (player 31 vs. dealer 30 = win).\
    \ The inconsistency lies in the mislabeled outcome, not the strategy. The player’s\
    \ actions were optimal: hitting to 31 (exploiting Ace elasticity) and standing\
    \ maximized survival while beating the dealer. The loss likely stems from a recording\
    \ error, as the logic and math confirm a player victory. The underlying issue\
    \ is external data misalignment, not flawed reasoning.\n\n    Following the previous\
    \ rigorous analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral\
    \ Guidelines and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you\
    \ consider to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral strategy and\n   \
    \ suggestions. World Modeling is about the description of the game and the dealer.\n\
    \n    Here are some suggestions for you:\n\n    Behavoiral Guideline\n       \
    \ 1-Goal: Please summarize the detailed goal based on your reflection ...\n  \
    \      2-Strategy: What kind of strategy can lead you to win in similar games\
    \ ...\n        3-Demonstration: Can this game be considered a typical example\

    \ or details\n        that are easy to overlook ...\n\n\n    Update previous policies\
    \ that you used to have to better match your current understanding.\n\n    Previous\
    \ Behavoiral Guideline:\n    **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Balance\
    \ aggressive growth with survival prioritization by dynamically adjusting target\
    \ thresholds based on phase transitions. Pursue 27-30 only when achievable with\
    \ ≤65% bust risk, while preserving existing totals ≥24 against low upcards (2-6)\
    \ to exploit dealer’s forced-hit obligations.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase-Transition\
    \ Protocol**:  \n     - At 24-26 totals: Stand against upcards 2-6 (dealer bust\
    \ prob. 45-52%) unless Ace remains flexible  \n     - At 27-30: Stand universally\
    \ against upcards 7-K, stand against 2-6 only if hidden high-card prob. <35% \
    \ \n   - **Ace Elasticity Management**:  \n     - Keep Ace as 11 until total reaches\
    \ 28, then auto-convert to 1 if subsequent hit risks >31  \n     - Prohibit hitting\
    \ on soft 27+ (Ace+16) to avoid dead-end conversions  \n   - **Bust Probability\
    \ Firewalls**:  \n     - Cease hitting at 24+ against low upcards (2-6) – dealer’s\
    \ 47% avg bust chance outweighs 62% player bust risk when hitting  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game as *Overreach Cascade Exemplar* – illustrates catastrophic\
    \ value destruction when violating phase-transition limits (hitting at 24/25 against\
    \ upcard 2), despite favorable dealer dynamics.\n\n    Previous World Modeling:\n\
    \    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Immediate Bust Supremacy**:\
    \ Player busts lose instantly regardless of dealer’s subsequent result – survival\
    \ becomes absolute priority past 23 total  \n   - **Dealer Hit Momentum**: Low\
    \ upcards (2-6) create compounding bust risk (each forced hit adds 28-33% bust\
    \ probability per card) but require player survival to capitalize  \n   - **Ace\
    \ Conversion Irreversibility**: Post-conversion rigidity transforms strategic\
    \ landscape – soft totals below 28 must preserve Ace flexibility  \n2. **Policy\
    \ Updates**:  \n   - **Bust-Adjusted Thresholds**:  \n     - Upcard 2-6: Stand\

    \ at 26+ (dealer bust 58% vs player hit bust 68%)  \n   - **Deck-State Integration**:\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Maximize total toward 31 while\
    \ maintaining zero bust risk through Ace elasticity optimization. Prioritize reaching\
    \ 28-31 when mathematically feasible (soft totals with Ace=11), but enforce hard\
    \ stops at survival-critical thresholds against dealer upcard dynamics.  \n2.\
    \ **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase-Transition Protocol (Revised)**:  \n     - Stand\
    \ automatically at 31 regardless of upcards (absolute terminal value)  \n    \
    \ - Against upcards 7-9: Hit until 27+ with Ace=11 preserved, stand at 28+ if\
    \ conversion to hard total would create ≤31  \n   - **Ace Elasticity Management\
    \ (Enhanced)**:  \n     - Maintain Ace=11 until total reaches 29 (was 28) to enable\
    \ safer hit opportunities  \n     - Allow 1 controlled hit on soft 28 (Ace+17)\
    \ if dealer upcard 7-9 shows high bust potential  \n   - **Bust Immunity Protocol**:\
    \  \n     - Never hit hard totals ≥24 against upcards 2-6  \n     - Never hit\
    \ soft totals ≥28 against upcards 7-K  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve as *Optimal\
    \ Ace Utilization Exemplar* – demonstrates maximum value extraction (31 total)\

    \   - **Dealer Final Total Range**: Dealers can legally reach 27-31 totals through\
    \ forced hitting (not capped at 27), requiring players to actively compete rather\
    \ than passively rely on dealer busts  \n   - **Ace Dual-Value Permanence**: Ace\
    \ remains convertible even after standing – final conversion occurs at hand resolution,\
    \ not action phase  \n2. **Policy Updates (Enhanced)**:  \n   - **Upcard-Specific\
    \ Thresholds**:  \n     - Upcard 7-9: Stand at 28+ (was 27+) when Ace=11 preserved,\
    \ as dealer needs 20+ in hidden cards to avoid mandatory hits  \n   - **31-Priority\
    \ Calculus**:  \n     - Calculate exact cards needed to reach 31 from current\
    \ total – if ≤3 cards required and no bust risk, prioritize hitting  \n3. **Strategic\
    \ Calibration**:  \n   - **Value Maximization Matrix**:  \n     - Upcard 2-6:\

    \ \n     - Upcard 10-K: 26+ (bust shield)  \n\n**Key Strategic Evolution**:  \n\
    - **31-Target Internalization**: Recognizes 31 as unique terminal value requiring\
    \ prioritized pursuit when Ace flexibility allows  \n- **Delayed Ace Conversion**:\
    \ Extends Ace=11 retention to 29 totals for enhanced strategic optionality  \n\
