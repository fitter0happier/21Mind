    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game. Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 31 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 31, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\
    \ hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit until their cards\
    \ total 27 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Spade K}. The dealer has\
    \ another hidden card. You don't know what it is. Your current cards are {Spade\
    \ J,Club Q}. Behavioral guideline: **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Prioritize\
    \ phase-specific survival thresholds while strategically pursuing 28-31 totals\
    \ against dealer 9/J/Q/K/A. Balance aggression with hard stops to prevent self-inflicted\
    \ busts.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase-Locked Limits**:  \n     - Early\
    \ phase (≤2 cards): Hit until 27 *unless* dealer shows ≤8. Suspend \"projected\
    \ total\" logic - treat 27 as mandatory early stopping point.  \n     - Mid-phase\
    \ (3 cards): Hard stand at 26+ (override 15% bust risk rule). Only hit at ≤25\
    \ *if* remaining 7+/A ≤18% (revised formula: (high-risk cards remaining ÷ deck\
    \ size) × 1.8).  \n     - Late phase (≥4 cards): Absolute stand at 25+ (27 threshold\
    \ caused overextension). Ace conversion permitted *only* to prevent busts, not\
    \ enable hits.  \n   - **Ace Protocol**: Retain Aces as 11 until total reaches\
    \ 29. Convert only if subsequent hit would otherwise bust.  \n   - **Dealer Pressure\
    \ Response**: If dealer visible ≥9, accept 27 as viable total rather than mandatory\
    \ 28+ target when in late phase.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game as\
    \ cautionary example - 4-card 26 with Ace should trigger stand per new late-phase\
    \ limits, not conversion-enabled hit.\nWorld modeling: **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Dealer Resilience**: Visible 10/J with 70% hidden 7-9 creates 73%\
    \ probability of dealer reaching 27-30 through 2-4 small hits (≤6 value). Player\
    \ totals above 25 become critical survival points.  \n   - **Bust Illusion**:\
    \ Dealer sequences creating 27-30 totals often involve temporary totals of 18-24,\
    \ misleading players into overestimating bust likelihood.  \n2. **Policy Updates**:\
    \  \n   - **Hidden Card Model**: When dealer shows 10/J, assign 75% probability\
    \ to hidden 6-9 (not 7-9) to account for enhanced low-card clustering.  \n   -\
    \ **Phase Interaction**: Late-phase stands now factor cards already drawn - 4+\
    \ player cards reduce dealer's available low cards by 22% per hit.  \n3. **Critical\
    \ Recognition**: 58% of player busts against visible 10/J occur in attempts to\
    \ reach ≥28 - new strategy caps targets at phase-appropriate levels regardless\
    \ of dealer potential.  \n\n**Key Strategic Shifts**:  \n- **Survival Primacy**:\
    \ Phase thresholds override all target alignment logic  \n- **Ace Conservation**:\
    \ Eliminate proactive Ace conversion - only use as bust prevention tool  \n- **Risk\
    \ Compression**: Mid-phase bust tolerance reduced from 15% to 9% through revised\
    \ multiplier (×1.8 vs ×2.3)  \n\n**Validation Fix**: Prevents late-phase overextension\
    \ by locking stands at 25+ with ≥4 cards, while more accurately modeling dealer's\
    \ hidden card range and low-card clustering tendencies.\nPlease read the behavioral\
    \ guideline and world modeling carefully. Then you should analyze your own cards\
    \ and your strategies in Self-belief and then analyze the dealer cards in World-belief.\
