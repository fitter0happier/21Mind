    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\

    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\
    \ hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit until their cards\
    \ total 27 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Club 9}. The dealer has another\
    \ hidden card. You don't know what it is. Your current cards are {Club 6,Spade\

    \ win probability by strategically balancing aggression and survival. Prioritize\
    \ avoiding immediate busts (which cause instant loss) over chasing marginal gains,\
    \ especially against high dealer cards (7-10). Force the dealer into risky draws\
    \ by surviving to their turn.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Stand Thresholds**:\
    \  \n     - **Stand at 25+ with 3+ cards** against dealer 7-10 (reduced bust flexibility\
    \ in multi-card hands).  \n     - **Stand at 26+ with 2-card hands** against dealer\
    \ 7-10 (acknowledge 60%+ bust risk from 7-K cards).  \n     - **Stand at 24+**\
    \ against dealer ≤6 (exploit dealer’s need for large draws).  \n   - **Hand Flexibility**:\
    \ Favor standing earlier with 3+ cards (e.g., 25 with 3 cards = stand) due to\
    \ limited bust-avoidance options.  \n   - **Deck Awareness**: If ≥40% of remaining\
    \ cards are 7-K, avoid hitting at 24+ against high dealer cards.  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game to illustrate:  \n   - Standing at 25 (3-card hand) against\
    \ dealer 8 avoids ~54% bust risk and exploits dealer’s forced hits.  \n   - Survivorship\
    \ bias: Players must stay alive to benefit from dealer bust cascades.  \n\n---\n\
    World modeling: **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Bust-Order\
    \ Asymmetry**: Player busts end the game immediately; dealer busts only matter\
    \ if the player survives.  \n   - **Dealer Forced Action**: Dealers *must* hit\
    \ until ≥27, even if their hidden card creates a vulnerable total (e.g., 8+9=17\
    \ → dealer keeps hitting).  \n   - **Cascade Bust Potential**: Dealers with low\
    \ hidden totals (e.g., 8+9=17) risk multi-draw busts (17→27→37) but require the\
    \ player to survive to capitalize on this.  \n   - **High-Value Saturation**:\
    \ 7-K constitute ~46% of card values (6/13), making hits at 24+ inherently risky.\
    \  \n\n**Policy Update**  \n- **Previous Guideline**: \"Hit ≤25 against high dealer\
    \ cards\" → **Revised**: \"Stand at 25+ with 3+ cards against dealer 7-10; hit\
    \ only 24-25 with 2-card hands.\"  \n- **Previous World Model**: Underestimated\
    \ dealer’s vulnerability to forced bust cascades → **Revised**: Explicitly model\
    \ dealer’s mandatory hits as a survivorship lever.  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic\
    \ Shift**:  \nAggression is *conditional*: High totals (25+) with limited flexibility\
    \ (3+ cards) warrant standing against strong dealer cards. Forcing the dealer\
    \ to draw 2+ cards amplifies their bust risk, but only if the player survives\
    \ to witness it.\nPlease read the behavioral guideline and world modeling carefully.\
