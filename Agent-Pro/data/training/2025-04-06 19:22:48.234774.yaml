    \ \n     - **Stand at 24+ with 3 cards** (prevents 4-card bust cascades; e.g.,\
    \ 24/3 → hitting risks 50%+ bust chance).  \n     - **Stand at 22+ vs. dealer\
    \ 10/J/Q/K upcards** (dealer likely reaches 27+ with 2-3 cards; prioritize survivorship\

    \ to enforce:  \n   - **23/3 vs. Q-upcard → mandatory stand** (bust risk >40%,\
    \ tiebreaker loss likely).  \n   - **Q-upcard dominance**: Dealers with 10-face\

    \ has **~40% probability of 7-10** (total 17-20). This lets them reach 27+ in\
    \ 1-2 draws (e.g., hidden 8 → 18 → hit 9 → 27/3).  \n   - **Forced Bust Dynamics**:\
    \ Dealers *must* hit into potential busts (e.g., Q+2=12 → needs 15+ to reach 27,\
    \ high bust risk), but 10-upcards reduce this likelihood.  \n   - **Tiebreaker\
    \ Fallacy**: Rules may ignore card counts, making 27/4 vs. 27/3 a loss. Assume\
    \ ties favor the dealer.  \n\n**Policy Updates**:  \n- **Previous**: “Stand at\
    \ 27+ with 2 cards” → **Revised**: “Stand at **25+ with 2 cards** vs. dealer 10-upcard”\
    \ (preemptively secure structural advantage).  \n- **Previous**: Flexible 3-card\
    \ hits → **Revised**: “**3-card hands ≥22 always stand** vs. dealer 10/J/Q/K”.\

    \ upcard strength**:  \n- **Dealer ≤6**: Exploit their high bust risk by chasing\
    \ 31/2-card 27+.  \n- **Dealer ≥7**: Lock in 22+/2-3 cards early—dealer’s strong\
