- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player''s Self-Belief incorrectly
    assessed a 55%+ bust risk when hitting a 3-card 21 total, despite **zero actual
    bust risk** (21 + 10 = 31 ≤ 31). This flawed belief caused an unnecessary Stand,
    leaving the player at 21. Meanwhile, the dealer’s forced hits (to ≥27) resulted
    in a 31 total. The inconsistency stemmed from miscalculating bust probabilities,
    violating the guideline’s aggression limits: hitting 21/3 had **no bust risk**
    and a 30.7% chance to reach 28–31 (7–10 draw), aligning with the strategy’s survivorship-first
    aggression. Standing at 21 guaranteed a loss against the dealer’s probable high
    finish. The loss originated from misapplying risk thresholds, not strategy adherence.'

    \ lose.\n\nPolicy-Level Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player's\
    \ Self-Belief incorrectly assessed a 55%+ bust risk when hitting a 3-card 21 total,\
    \ despite **zero actual bust risk** (21 + 10 = 31 ≤ 31). This flawed belief caused\
    \ an unnecessary Stand, leaving the player at 21. Meanwhile, the dealer’s forced\
    \ hits (to ≥27) resulted in a 31 total. The inconsistency stemmed from miscalculating\
    \ bust probabilities, violating the guideline’s aggression limits: hitting 21/3\
    \ had **no bust risk** and a 30.7% chance to reach 28–31 (7–10 draw), aligning\
    \ with the strategy’s survivorship-first aggression. Standing at 21 guaranteed\
    \ a loss against the dealer’s probable high finish. The loss originated from misapplying\
    \ risk thresholds, not strategy adherence.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous\
    \ analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines\
    \ and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you consider\
    \ to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral strategy and\n    suggestions.\
    \ World Modeling is about the description of the game and the dealer.\n\n    Here\
    \ are some suggestions for you:\n\n    Behavoiral Guideline\n        1-Goal: Please\
    \ summarize the detailed goal based on your reflection ...\n        2-Strategy:\
    \ What kind of strategy can lead you to win in similar games ...\n        3-Demonstration:\
    \ Can this game be considered a typical example to be preserved for\n        future\

    \ recent reflection , describe any game rules or details\n        that are easy\
    \ to overlook ...\n\n\n    Update previous policies that you used to have to better\
    \ match your current understanding.\n\n    Previous Behavoiral Guideline:\n  \
    \  **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Secure survivorship by **strictly\
    \ enforcing stand thresholds (≥26 for 3/4-card hands)**. Pursue 28+ *only when*\
    \ doing so does not violate survivorship thresholds. Prioritize avoiding busts\
    \ over chasing marginal gains.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Stand Thresholds**:\
    \  \n     - **3/4-card hands**: **Stand immediately at ≥26** vs. dealer 7+ upcards.\
    \ Do not hit even for 31 potential.  \n     - **2-card hands**: Stand at ≥23 *only*\
    \ if bust risk >40% (e.g., 23 vs. dealer 10). Otherwise, prioritize reaching 26+\
    \ first.  \n   - **Aggression Limits**:  \n     - Hit below 26 only if: (1) 28+\
    \ is achievable with 1 draw (e.g., 20/3 can safely hit to 28–30), and (2) bust\
    \ risk ≤25% (e.g., 25/3 cannot hit).  \n     - Chase 31 **exclusively with ≤3-card\
    \ soft hands (A+X+Y)** when dealer ≤6.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this\
    \ game as a **threshold adherence success case**—standing at 30/4 vs. dealer 10\
    \ avoided unnecessary bust and secured victory.  \n\n---\n\n    Previous World\
    \ Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer’s\
    \ Forced Draws**: Dealers *must* hit until ≥27, giving them a **~68% chance to\
    \ reach 27–31**. Player totals <26 lose >90% of the time.  \n   - **Hidden Card\
    \ Dynamics**: Dealer’s hidden card is most likely 7–9 (35% probability), creating\
    \ a baseline 17–19. With forced draws, this converts to 27–31 in 72% of cases.\
    \  \n   - **Outcome Validation**: Game records may mislabel wins/losses—cross-check\
    \ dealer totals against player actions to avoid conflating strategy errors with\
    \ data inaccuracies.  \n\n**Policy Updates**:  \n- **Previous**: “Stand at 26+/3-4\
    \ cards regardless of 28 target” → **Revised**: “Stand at 26+/3-4 cards *even\
    \ if 31 is achievable* (e.g., 26/4 vs. dealer 10: stand).”  \n- **Previous**:\
    \ “Focus on absolute totals over tiebreakers” → **Revised**: “Ignore tiebreakers\
    \ entirely; prioritize totals ≥27 to offset dealer’s forced high finishes.”  \n\
    \n---  \n**Key Strategic Shift**:  \n- **Survivorship-First Aggression**:  \n\
    \  - Against dealer 7+, **26+ is non-negotiable**—no exceptions for 28+ pursuits.\
    \  \n  - Against dealer ≤6, **build 27+/2-card hands** to exploit dealer’s lower\
    \ finishing range (27–29).\n    "

    \ hand where total + 10 ≤ 31 (e.g., 21/3, 22/4) cannot bust—this supersedes stand\
    \ thresholds.  \n   - **Hidden Card Bias**: Dealer’s hidden card averages 8.2\
