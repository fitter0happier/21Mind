    \ sequences.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Probabilistic Thresholds**:  \n   \
    \  - For dealer visible ≥6: Target 24-28 with ≤35% bust risk in late phase (≥4\

    \ elevated Ace/10 density.  \n   - **Phase-Adaptive Aggression**:  \n     - Early\
    \ phase (≤3 cards): Prioritize reaching ≥25 over bust avoidance (hit ≤29 if projected\
    \ total ≥25).  \n     - Late phase (≥4 cards): Stand at ≥25 *unless* dealer visible\
    \ card ≤5 AND remaining deck has <20% high cards (10/A).  \n   - **Variance Mitigation**:\
    \ Preserve 24-25 totals only when dealer visible card ≥8 (reduced flexibility\

    \ card sequences (e.g., hidden 10 + immediate Ace draw), emphasizing probabilistic\
    \ dominance over outcome fixation.\nWorld modeling: **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **High-Card Leap Risk**: Dealers holding hidden 10 can bypass multi-hit\
    \ requirements with single high draws (e.g., 20 → 31 via Ace). This occurs in\
    \ 4.2% of games but devastates otherwise sound strategies.  \n   - **Ace Elasticity**:\
    \ Aces allow dealers to make +11 leaps, compressing their required hit count.\
    \ Player totals ≥26 partially mitigate this by forcing dealers to take risky intermediate\
    \ steps before Ace plays.  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: Dual-path\
    \ (9/10) simulation → **Revised**: \"Triangulate hidden 9/10/A scenarios when\
    \ dealer visible card ≥10.\"  \n   - **Previous**: Static late-phase bust risk\
    \ limits → **Revised**: \"Adjust late-phase bust tolerance to 40% if deck has\
    \ ≥3 visible low cards (2-6).\"  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic Shifts**:  \n- **Probabilistic\
    \ Surge Control**: Accept controlled failure rates (<5%) from dealer high-card\
    \ leaps to maintain aggression against 95%+ of probable scenarios.  \n- **Ace-Aware\
    \ Thresholding**: Treat player totals 25-26 as minimum viable against dealers\
    \ with visible 10/J/Q/K, reducing vulnerability to single-card dealer surges.\
