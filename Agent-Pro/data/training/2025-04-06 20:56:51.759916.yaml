    \ for ≤3 cards, ≤45% for ≥4 cards), even if standing guarantees loss.  \n2. **Strategy**:\
    \  \n   - **Phase-Locked Aggression**:  \n     - **Early Game (≤3 cards)**: Tolerate\
    \ ≤55% bust risk to reach 28+.  \n     - **Late Game (≥4 cards)**: Cap bust risk\
    \ at 45%—**stand immediately if exceeded**, regardless of dealer’s threat.  \n\
    \   - **Loss Acceptance Protocol**: If standing at sub-28 totals guarantees loss\
    \ but hitting exceeds phase bust caps, **stand and concede**—prioritize long-term\
    \ risk discipline over short-term variance.  \n   - **Threshold Adjustment**:\
    \  \n     - Against dealer 10/J/Q/K: Hit 24–27 only if bust risk ≤ phase cap.\
    \ At 28/2-3 cards, hit unless bust risk >60%.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve\
    \ this game as a **phase-compliance failure**—violating late-game 45% bust cap\

    \ 21% of cases, but **27–29 totals occur 63% of the time**—sub-28 player totals\
    \ still lose >60% even if dealer doesn’t hit 30+.  \n     - **Hidden Card Multi-Hit\
    \ Potential**: Dealers averaging 2.3 additional cards after hitting 17–26 often\
    \ achieve 27–29 (e.g., Q + 7 → 17 → hit to 27 via 10).  \n   - **Bust Probability\
