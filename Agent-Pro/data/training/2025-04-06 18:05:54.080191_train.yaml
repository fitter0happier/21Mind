    despite holding 23 with 3+ cards violated the **Stand Thresholds** in the Behavioral
    Guideline (Stand at 25+ with 3+ cards against dealer 9). By hitting at 23 (4-card
    hand), they risked busting for minimal gain, directly causing the loss. The Self-Belief
    incorrectly prioritized improving a survivable total over adhering to survivorship
    principles. The World-Belief accurately recognized the dealer’s forced draws but
    underestimated the high bust probability from overcommitting to aggression. The
    underlying issue was misapplying the strategy: aiming for *above 27* should not
    justify reckless hits below 25, especially with 4+ cards, where low flexibility

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Prioritize survivorship above\
    \ all else while strategically standing at totals that pressure the dealer into\
    \ high-bust-risk draws. Avoid ties at 27 *unless unavoidable*, and never sacrifice\
    \ survivorship for marginal gains below 25 with 3+ cards.  \n2. **Strategy**:\
    \  \n   - **Revised Stand Thresholds**:  \n     - **Stand at 24+ with 4+ cards**\
    \ against dealer 7-10 (lower threshold due to extreme bust risk with ≥4 cards).\
    \  \n     - **Stand at 25+ with 3 cards** (preserve survivorship while allowing\
    \ room for dealer bust cascades).  \n     - **Never hit 23+ with 4+ cards** (bust\
    \ probability >40% outweighs potential gains).  \n   - **Aggression Limits**:\
    \  \n     - Only chase totals >27 if achievable with ≤2 cards (e.g., 21→28 via\
    \ 7).  \n     - Treat 4+ card hands as inflexible—prioritize immediate survival\
    \ over dealer bust potential.  \n   - **Tie Mitigation**: Avoid reaching 27 with\
    \ 3+ cards unless forced; prefer 25-26 to exploit dealer overdraws.  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game as a *negative example*:  \n   - Hitting 23 (4-card hand)\
    \ against dealer 9 violates survivorship principles—standing would have allowed\
    \ dealer bust potential.  \n   - Aggression below 24 with 4+ cards is counterproductive\
    \ due to catastrophic bust risk.  \n\n---\n\n**World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Dealer Path Dependency**: Dealers with hidden cards ≤18 (e.g., 9+9=18)\
    \ will draw 2+ times, creating bust cascades (18→28→bust) or safe stops (18→28→31).\
    \  \n   - **Tie Inevitability**: If dealer’s hidden card creates a starting total\
    \ of 18-26, they will *always* reach 27-31 unless they bust. Player totals of\
    \ 27+ guarantee ties unless dealer busts.  \n   - **Card Count Impact**: Dealers\
    \ holding 2-card 27s (e.g., 9+18) automatically tie player 27s, while 3+ card\
    \ 27s are player losses (dealer wins same totals with fewer cards).  \n\n**Policy\
    \ Update**  \n- **Previous Guideline**: \"Stand at 25+ with 3+ cards\" → **Revised**:\
    \ \"Stand at 24+ with 4+ cards; 25+ with 3 cards.\"  \n- **Previous World Model**:\
    \ Assumed dealer bust likelihood dominates → **Revised**: Explicitly model dealer’s\
    \ 27+ attainment rate (~55% for 9-upcard scenarios) and tie frequency (~30%).\
    \  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic Shift**:  \nAggression must *align with hand flexibility*.\
    \ Survivorship is non-negotiable for 4+ card hands—standing at 24+ forces dealers\
    \ into multi-draw bust risks while avoiding self-destructive overreach. Chasing\
    \ totals >27 is only viable with 2-card hands (e.g., 21→28 via 7). This game exemplifies\
    \ the penalty for misjudging hand rigidity."
