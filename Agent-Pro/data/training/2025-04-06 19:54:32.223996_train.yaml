    stand threshold (≥26 for 3/4-card hands) was correct, as they stood at 30/4 cards.
    However, the final result (player win) contradicts the framing of this as a "losing
    game," suggesting a misalignment in the game record. The dealer’s hidden card
    (H9) and subsequent draw (H9) created a 28 total, which the player’s 30 legitimately
    beat. The player’s actions were consistent with the guidelines, and no strategic
    error occurred here. The perceived "loss" likely stems from an incorrect game
    record or misinterpretation, as the logic and execution were sound. This highlights
    the importance of verifying game outcomes against strategy rules to avoid conflating

    \ The player's adherence to the strict stand threshold (≥26 for 3/4-card hands)\
    \ was correct, as they stood at 30/4 cards. However, the final result (player\
    \ win) contradicts the framing of this as a \"losing game,\" suggesting a misalignment\
    \ in the game record. The dealer’s hidden card (H9) and subsequent draw (H9) created\
    \ a 28 total, which the player’s 30 legitimately beat. The player’s actions were\
    \ consistent with the guidelines, and no strategic error occurred here. The perceived\
    \ \"loss\" likely stems from an incorrect game record or misinterpretation, as\
    \ the logic and execution were sound. This highlights the importance of verifying\
    \ game outcomes against strategy rules to avoid conflating record errors with\
    \ policy flaws.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous analysis, you should distill\
