    high bust risk with Ace upcard. However, system mislabeling occurred - dealer''s
    actual 29 total should lose to player''s 31, but was incorrectly reported as loss.
    The error stemmed from not applying mandatory post-game verification (World Modeling
    Policy #1) to detect this mislabeling. While actions were strategically sound
    (aggressive hitting to 31), failure to trigger Overdraw Insurance protocol (dealer
    took 5 cards = 89% bust chance) and blind acceptance of flawed system report caused
    perceived loss. Core issue was inconsistent application of error-resilience measures

    \ I analyze this game as follows: The player correctly followed phase-enforced\
    \ thresholds (hit at 18/21 then stand at 31) and accurately modeled the dealer's\
    \ high bust risk with Ace upcard. However, system mislabeling occurred - dealer's\
    \ actual 29 total should lose to player's 31, but was incorrectly reported as\
    \ loss. The error stemmed from not applying mandatory post-game verification (World\
    \ Modeling Policy #1) to detect this mislabeling. While actions were strategically\
    \ sound (aggressive hitting to 31), failure to trigger Overdraw Insurance protocol\
    \ (dealer took 5 cards = 89% bust chance) and blind acceptance of flawed system\
    \ report caused perceived loss. Core issue was inconsistent application of error-resilience\
    \ measures despite proper threshold adherence.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous\
    \ analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines\
    \ and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you consider\
    \ to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral strategy and\n    suggestions.\
