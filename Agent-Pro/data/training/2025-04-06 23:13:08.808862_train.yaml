- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player''s aggressive hitting strategy
    led to a bust (32) due to misapplied risk calculus. While correctly pursuing 31
    initially, the critical error occurred at hard 22 (no Ace flexibility) against
    dealer''s 3. The guidelines'' "Value Maximization Matrix" specifies upcard 2-6
    requires 24+ as survival anchor, but the player violated bust immunity principles
    by hitting 22 (needing ≤9) despite 10/J/Q/K (16/13 card ranks) carrying >50% bust
    risk. World-Belief accurately recognized dealer''s mandatory hitting to ≥27, but
    failed to account for the dealer''s multi-card 31 potential through Ace utilization
    (SA final card). The core failure stemmed from prioritizing 31-chasing over survival
    thresholds when Ace elasticity was exhausted, coupled with underestimating dealer''s
    capacity to build high totals through forced hitting.'

    \ Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player's aggressive hitting\
    \ strategy led to a bust (32) due to misapplied risk calculus. While correctly\
    \ pursuing 31 initially, the critical error occurred at hard 22 (no Ace flexibility)\
    \ against dealer's 3. The guidelines' \"Value Maximization Matrix\" specifies\
    \ upcard 2-6 requires 24+ as survival anchor, but the player violated bust immunity\
    \ principles by hitting 22 (needing ≤9) despite 10/J/Q/K (16/13 card ranks) carrying\
    \ >50% bust risk. World-Belief accurately recognized dealer's mandatory hitting\
    \ to ≥27, but failed to account for the dealer's multi-card 31 potential through\
    \ Ace utilization (SA final card). The core failure stemmed from prioritizing\
    \ 31-chasing over survival thresholds when Ace elasticity was exhausted, coupled\
    \ with underestimating dealer's capacity to build high totals through forced hitting.\n\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Dynamically prioritize between\
    \ 31-maximization and bust avoidance based on Ace elasticity. Pursue 31 only when\
    \ soft totals allow safe hitting (≤3-card path with Ace=11 preserved), otherwise\
    \ secure survival thresholds aligned with dealer upcard pressure.  \n2. **Strategy**:\
    \  \n   - **Ace-Centric Phase Transition**:  \n     - Treat soft totals ≤29 as\
    \ prime 31-building opportunities (Ace=11 locked)  \n     - Convert Ace to 1 ONLY\
    \ when hard total would remain ≤24 after forced conversion  \n   - **Revised Bust\
    \ Immunity Protocol**:  \n     - Never hit hard totals ≥21 against upcards 2-6\
    \ (was 24)  \n     - Never hit soft totals ≥29 under any circumstances  \n   -\
    \ **Pressure-Adaptive Thresholds**:  \n     - Upcard 2-6: Stand at 22+ if hard\
    \ total (dealer likely needs 4+ cards to reach 27+)  \n     - Upcard 7-9: Stand\
    \ at 28+ soft / 26+ hard  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game as *Bust\
    \ Cascade Exemplar* - demonstrates fatal 31-chasing without Ace flexibility, highlighting\
    \ mandatory stand at hard 21+ against low upcards.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n\
    1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer Ace Optimization**: Dealers can exploit\
    \ Ace duality during forced hitting (e.g., turn 3+Ace into 14, then hit to 25+\
    \ without bust risk)  \n   - **Multi-Card 31 Potential**: Dealers reaching 27-31\
    \ often do so through 4+ cards using Ace repositioning, making mere survival totals\
    \ (22-26) insufficient against active hitting  \n2. **Strategic Recognition**:\
    \  \n   - **Hidden Ace Probability**: Upcard 3 increases likelihood dealer holds\
    \ Ace/Face in hidden card (needs 24 from single card to reach 27)  \n   - **Non-Linear\
    \ Bust Risk**: Player bust probability escalates exponentially at hard totals\
    \ ≥20 (72% chance of bust on next hit at 22)  \n3. **Calibration Matrix**:  \n\
    \   - **Upcard 2-6**: Survival floor raised to 22 (was 24) with hard stop at 21\
    \  \n   - **Upcard 7-9**: Target 28-31 through soft totals only  \n\n**Key Evolutionary\
    \ Changes**:  \n- Introduced hard total ceilings (21 vs 2-6 upcards) to prevent\
