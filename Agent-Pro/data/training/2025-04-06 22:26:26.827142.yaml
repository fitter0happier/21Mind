    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\

    \ Q/J/K upcards (*58% dealer bust exploit*), then target 27  \n     - Mid (3 cards):\
    \ Stand at 28+ (*+1 error buffer*) unless dealer shows A, with parallel hidden-card\
    \ probability calc  \n     - Late (≥4 cards): Stand at 27+ but auto-hit below\
