- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player''s Self-Belief correctly identified
    mid-phase status (3 cards, total 26) but failed to account for the **actual high-card
    density impact**. While the bust risk was estimated at >30%, standing at 26 against
    the dealer’s visible J (10) was justified per the guideline. However, the World-Belief
    critically misjudged the dealer’s hidden card probabilities: the dealer’s hidden
    H8 (8) created a starting total of 18 (J + 8), allowing them to hit safely to
    28 (J+8+10) without busting. The player’s belief in dealer incrementalism (55%
    bust risk per hit) was contradicted by the dealer drawing a 10 (low incremental
    bust risk from 18→28). The loss stemmed from **overconfidence in dealer bust odds**
    while underestimating the dealer’s capacity to land mid-range totals (27-30) through
    favorable draws. The guideline’s "stand ≥23 vs visible ≥7" policy proved flawed
    here, as 26 was insufficient against the dealer’s 28—highlighting a need to recalibrate
    mid-phase thresholds when dealer visible cards indicate strong incremental potential
    (J/10).'

    \nPolicy-Level Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player's Self-Belief\
    \ correctly identified mid-phase status (3 cards, total 26) but failed to account\
    \ for the **actual high-card density impact**. While the bust risk was estimated\
    \ at >30%, standing at 26 against the dealer’s visible J (10) was justified per\
    \ the guideline. However, the World-Belief critically misjudged the dealer’s hidden\
    \ card probabilities: the dealer’s hidden H8 (8) created a starting total of 18\
    \ (J + 8), allowing them to hit safely to 28 (J+8+10) without busting. The player’s\
    \ belief in dealer incrementalism (55% bust risk per hit) was contradicted by\
    \ the dealer drawing a 10 (low incremental bust risk from 18→28). The loss stemmed\
    \ from **overconfidence in dealer bust odds** while underestimating the dealer’s\
    \ capacity to land mid-range totals (27-30) through favorable draws. The guideline’s\
    \ \"stand ≥23 vs visible ≥7\" policy proved flawed here, as 26 was insufficient\
    \ against the dealer’s 28—highlighting a need to recalibrate mid-phase thresholds\
    \ when dealer visible cards indicate strong incremental potential (J/10).\n\n\
    \    Following the previous rigorous analysis, you should distill and articulate\
    \ a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline\
    \ is about what\n    you consider to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral\
    \ strategy and\n    suggestions. World Modeling is about the description of the\
    \ game and the dealer.\n\n    Here are some suggestions for you:\n\n    Behavoiral\

    \ reflection ...\n        2-Strategy: What kind of strategy can lead you to win\

    \ any game rules or details\n        that are easy to overlook ...\n\n\n    Update\
    \ previous policies that you used to have to better match your current understanding.\n\
    \n    Previous Behavoiral Guideline:\n    **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**:\
    \ Achieve totals ≥25 with *adaptive bust risk containment*, prioritizing survival\
    \ in late phases while maintaining aggression against dealer’s most probable paths\
    \ (hidden 9/10).  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase Redefinition**:  \n     -\
    \ Early phase: ≤2 cards (unlimited aggression: hit ≤29 if projected ≥25).  \n\
    \     - Mid-phase: 3 cards (capped aggression: hit only if bust risk ≤25% and\
    \ projected total ≥25).  \n     - Late phase: ≥4 cards (defensive stance: stand\
    \ at ≥24 unless dealer visible ≤5 AND deck high-card density <15%).  \n   - **Dynamic\
    \ Bust Calculus**:  \n     - For 3-card hands, calculate bust risk as (remaining\
    \ 10/A cards ÷ total remaining cards) × 1.5 (reflects compounding risk).  \n \
    \    - If bust risk exceeds 30% in mid-phase, stand unless dealer visible ≥9.\
    \  \n   - **Ace-Proofing**: Treat 26 as the new minimum target against dealer\
    \ visible 10/J/Q/K, reducing reliance on 25 as \"safe.\"  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game to illustrate *mid-phase over-aggression pitfalls*: hitting\
    \ at 22 (3 cards) with ~38% bust risk (not 30%) due to high-card density oversight.\n\
    \n    Previous World Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Dealer Incrementalism**: Dealers with hidden 10 (total 20) require\
    \ 7+ to reach 27, creating a 45% bust risk per hit (assuming uniform card distribution).\
    \ This is more probable than Ace leaps (4.2%) but often overlooked.  \n   - **Card-Counting\
    \ Proxy**: Track visible low cards (2-6). Every 3 visible low cards reduce estimated\
    \ dealer bust risk by 12% but increase high-card density by 9%.  \n2. **Policy\
    \ Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: Triangulate 9/10/A scenarios → **Revised**:\
    \ \"Simulate dealer paths for hidden 8-10/A when visible card ≥9.\"  \n   - **Previous**:\
    \ Adjust late-phase tolerance → **Revised**: \"In mid-phase (3 cards), stand if\
    \ total ≥23 AND dealer visible ≥7.\"  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic Shifts**:  \n\
    - **Mid-Phase Discipline**: Curb aggression at 3 cards to avoid compounding bust\
    \ risks, acknowledging that 22+ totals already pressure dealers.  \n- **Dealer\
    \ Incremental Focus**: Prioritize countering dealer’s 55%-probable incremental\
    \ gains (e.g., hitting 20→27) over <5% Ace leaps.  \n- **Visible Low-Card Accounting**:\
    \ Use observed low cards to dynamically adjust both player bust risk and dealer\
    \ survival odds.  \n\n**Critical Fix**: This update replaces rigid phase definitions\
    \ with fluid risk calculus, hardening strategies against both dealer incrementalism\
    \ and player over-extension.\n\n    Always start description of new Behavoiral\

    \ Penalize decks with ≥4 visible high cards by inflating bust risk multipliers\
