    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game. Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 31 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 31, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\
    \ hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit until their cards\
    \ total 27 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Diamond 2}. The dealer has\
    \ another hidden card. You don't know what it is. Your current cards are {Club\
    \ 5,Heart J}. Behavioral guideline: **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Aggressively\
    \ pursue totals between 27-30 while balancing hidden card risks and dealer bust\
    \ potential. Prioritize achieving +3 margins over dealer’s minimum 27 threshold\
    \ when upcards ≤9, but preserve totals ≥28 against mid/high upcards (7-K) to exploit\
    \ dealer’s forced hit volatility.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Breadth of Survival\
    \ Protocol**:  \n     - Against upcards 7-9: Stand at 30 (even with Ace flexibility)\
    \ to capitalize on dealer’s 41% bust probability during forced hits  \n     -\
    \ Preserve Ace soft counts until 28+ but mandate conversion to 1 when hitting\
    \ would exceed 31 (prevents unnecessary busts at 30+)  \n   - **Mid-Upcard Paradox\
    \ Resolution**:  \n     - Treat 29-30 as victory anchors against dealer 9 upcards\
    \ rather than tie hazards, as dealer mid-card clustering creates bust-prone hit\
    \ chains  \n   - **Post-27 Risk Grading**:  \n     - At 28-30: Stand unless dealer\
    \ upcard ≤6 AND estimated hidden high-card probability ≥40%  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve as *Mid-Upcard Stability Illusion* – demonstrates that standing at\
    \ 30 against dealer 9 upcards is optimal despite tie risks, as dealer’s forced\
    \ hits introduce disproportionate bust likelihood.\nWorld modeling: **World Modeling**1.\
    \ **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Forced Hit Bust Cascade**: Dealers with mid\
    \ upcards (7-9) have 38-44% bust rates when starting with hidden 2-6 due to mandatory\
    \ hitting until 27, creating strategic safe zones at 28-30  \n   - **Ace Conversion\
    \ Finality**: Once Ace is converted to 1, reversion to 11 is permanently disabled\
    \ per game rules, requiring irreversible commitment to hard totals  \n   - **Tiebreaker\
    \ Activation**: Equal totals ONLY favor dealer if both parties survive – dealer\
    \ busts nullify tie resolution clauses  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Bust-Potential\
    \ Grading**:  \n     - Upcard 7-9: Assign 35-45% dealer bust probability when\
    \ initial total <27, justifying player stands at 28+  \n     - Upcard 10-K: Bust\
    \ probability rises to 58-63%, making 27-28 sufficient victory thresholds  \n\
    \   - **Ace Depletion Tracking**: Monitor remaining deck’s Ace density – <2 Aces\
    \ remaining triggers early Ace conversion at 27+ to avoid bust traps  \n3. **Strategic\
    \ Calibration**:  \n   - **Victory Threshold Matrix**:  \n     - Upcard 2-6: 28-30\
    \ (hidden high-card buffer)  \n     - Upcard 7-9: 28-30 (bust exploitation)  \n\
    \     - Upcard 10-K: 27-28 (high bust leverage)  \n\n**Key Strategic Evolution**:\
    \  \n- **Breadth-of-Survival Doctrine**: Replaces polarity-focused hitting with\
    \ dealer bust probability matrices for mid-upcard scenarios  \n- **Ace Depletion\
    \ Triggers**: Introduces deck-awareness to Ace conversion timing  \n- **Tiebreaker\
