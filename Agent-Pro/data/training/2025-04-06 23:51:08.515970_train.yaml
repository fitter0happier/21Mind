    consistent with the aggressive strategy, correctly prioritizing reaching ≥28 while
    managing 4-card fragility. The World-Belief accurately estimated the dealer’s
    compounding potential from their Q upcard. However, the final result (win) contradicts
    the user’s framing of a "losing game," suggesting a record inconsistency. The

    \ total verification and threshold precision – push toward 28-31 totals but immediately\
    \ secure gains when reaching 29+ in 4-card hands to override inherent fragility.\
    \  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Architecture-Locked Aggression**:  \n     - 3-card\
    \ hands: Hit until 27+ vs 5-6 upcards; 28+ vs 7-upcards unless dealer’s hidden\
    \ card suggests ≤16 initial total  \n     - 4-card hands: Auto-stand at 29+ (strictly\
    \ enforced), as even 29→31 bust risk (48-62%) outweighs marginal gain  \n   -\
    \ **Total Validation Protocol**:  \n     - Recalculate totals after every hit\
    \ to prevent miscalculation losses  \n     - Treat 31 as absolute cap – stand\
    \ immediately upon reaching it regardless of hand size  \n   - **Dealer Ambush\
    \ Neutralization**:  \n     - If dealer upcard ≤7, prioritize hitting to 28+ to\
    \ block their 27-28 stealth compounds  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve as *4-Card\

    \ Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer’s Hidden Leverage**:\
    \ Dealers with Q upcard have 45% probability of hidden card being ≤6 (initial\
    \ 12-16), granting them 38-41% chance to reach 27+ through compounding hits  \n\
    \   - **Total Enforcement Blindspot**: Players risk automatic loss from arithmetic\
    \ errors – 10% of historical losses stem from misadded totals rather than strategic\
    \ failure  \n   - **4-Card Collapse Curve**: Each additional card beyond 3 increases\
    \ bust risk by 20-25% per hit, making 4-card 29+ hands non-negotiable stand points\
    \  \n2. **Strategic Recognition**:  \n   - **Upcard Quantum States**:  \n    \
    \ - Q upcard splits into two realities: dealer initial total 17-20 (immediate\
    \ 27+ threat) vs 12-16 (delayed compounding threat)  \n     - Respond by building\
    \ ≥28 totals to cover both scenarios  \n   - **Threshold Elasticity 3.0**:  \n\
    \     - For every confirmed point below 17 in dealer’s initial total, reduce player\
    \ stand threshold by 0.75 (not 0.5) to account for compounded aggression needs\
    \  \n3. **Calibration Matrix**:  \n   - **Q-Upcard Response**: 27+ (3 cards)/29+\
    \ (4 cards) with total verification  \n   - **Critical Failure Points**: 4-card\
    \ 24+ totals have <35% survival rate on next hit – prohibited except when dealer’s\
    \ hidden card confirms ≤14 initial total  \n\n**Key Evolutionary Changes**:  \n\
    - Added mandatory total verification layer to all aggression protocols  \n- Increased\
    \ threshold elasticity sensitivity for Q-upcard scenarios  \n- Redefined 4-card\
