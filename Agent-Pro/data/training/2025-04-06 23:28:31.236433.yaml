    \ to force dealer 4+ card builds, but hit at 24 or below to chase 27+  \n    \
    \ - For upcards 7-9: Require 28+ hard (prev 27) to counter 3-card dealer compounding\
    \  \n   - **Ace-Less Optimization**:  \n     - Cap Ace-less totals at **28** (prev\
    \ 27) when dealer upcard ≤6, accepting 12% bust risk for 31 proximity  \n    \
    \ - Prioritize 4-card 25-28 ranges over 3-card stagnation  \n   - **Dealer Compounding\
    \ Mitigation**:  \n     - Treat dealer upcards 2-6 as high compounding threats,\
    \ not passive bust candidates  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game as *Low-Upcard\

    \ **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Low-Upcard Endurance**: Dealers with 4-upcard\

    \ Card Criticality**: Upcard 4 has 38% chance of hidden card ≥10 (e.g., 4+10=14\

    \ Mandate**: Player totals <27 lose 68% against 4-upcard dealers due to 3-card\

    \ chance but 62% chance to reach 26-31 – favorable vs 61% dealer survival  \n\
    3. **Calibration Matrix**:  \n   - **Upcard 2-6**: Survival floor = 25 hard (if\
    \ 3+ cards) / 27 hard (if 2 cards)  \n   - **Upcard 7-9**: Survival floor = 28\
    \ hard / 30 soft  \n\n**Key Evolutionary Changes**:  \n- Replaced static 23+ threshold\
