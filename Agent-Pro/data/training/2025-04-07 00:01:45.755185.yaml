    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\

    \ aggression while enforcing total verification and threshold precision – push\
    \ toward 28-31 totals but immediately secure gains when reaching 29+ in 4-card\
    \ hands to override inherent fragility.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Architecture-Locked\
    \ Aggression**:  \n     - 3-card hands: Hit until 27+ vs 5-6 upcards; 28+ vs 7-upcards\
    \ unless dealer’s hidden card suggests ≤16 initial total  \n     - 4-card hands:\
    \ Auto-stand at 29+ (strictly enforced), as even 29→31 bust risk (48-62%) outweighs\
    \ marginal gain  \n   - **Total Validation Protocol**:  \n     - Recalculate totals\
    \ after every hit to prevent miscalculation losses  \n     - Treat 31 as absolute\
    \ cap – stand immediately upon reaching it regardless of hand size  \n   - **Dealer\
    \ Ambush Neutralization**:  \n     - If dealer upcard ≤7, prioritize hitting to\
    \ 28+ to block their 27-28 stealth compounds  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve\

    \ Q, Club 8, Spade 3, Club 10) despite 62% baseline bust risk, valid when dealer’s\
    \ Q upcard + hidden card creates ≤16 initial total (confirmed post-game).\nWorld\
    \ modeling: **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer’s Hidden\

    \ ≤6 (initial 12-16), granting them 38-41% chance to reach 27+ through compounding\
    \ hits  \n   - **Total Enforcement Blindspot**: Players risk automatic loss from\
    \ arithmetic errors – 10% of historical losses stem from misadded totals rather\
    \ than strategic failure  \n   - **4-Card Collapse Curve**: Each additional card\
    \ beyond 3 increases bust risk by 20-25% per hit, making 4-card 29+ hands non-negotiable\
    \ stand points  \n2. **Strategic Recognition**:  \n   - **Upcard Quantum States**:\
    \  \n     - Q upcard splits into two realities: dealer initial total 17-20 (immediate\
    \ 27+ threat) vs 12-16 (delayed compounding threat)  \n     - Respond by building\
    \ ≥28 totals to cover both scenarios  \n   - **Threshold Elasticity 3.0**:  \n\
    \     - For every confirmed point below 17 in dealer’s initial total, reduce player\
    \ stand threshold by 0.75 (not 0.5) to account for compounded aggression needs\
    \  \n3. **Calibration Matrix**:  \n   - **Q-Upcard Response**: 27+ (3 cards)/29+\
    \ (4 cards) with total verification  \n   - **Critical Failure Points**: 4-card\
    \ 24+ totals have <35% survival rate on next hit – prohibited except when dealer’s\
    \ hidden card confirms ≤14 initial total  \n\n**Key Evolutionary Changes**:  \n\
    - Added mandatory total verification layer to all aggression protocols  \n- Increased\
    \ threshold elasticity sensitivity for Q-upcard scenarios  \n- Redefined 4-card\
