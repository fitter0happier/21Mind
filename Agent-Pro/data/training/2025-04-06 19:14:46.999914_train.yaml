    \ from misapplied aggression - chasing marginal total gains with high card counts\
    \ contradicted the revised strategy prioritizing \"28/2 > 30/4\" structural efficiency.\

    \ Self-Belief is {Current total 23 (3+K+Q) with 3 cards. Hitting could reach\n\
    \    24-31 (if Ace counts as 1) or bust. Aggression favors improving total despite\n\

    \ 'dealer [''C8'', ''HQ'', ''DJ''], player [''S3'', ''DK'', ''DQ'', ''CK''], '\n\
    \  final results: lose.\n\nPolicy-Level Reflection: I analyze this game as follows:\
    \ The player's Self-Belief correctly identified their 23/3-card hand needed improvement\
    \ but failed to account for critical risk thresholds. While the World-Belief accurately\
    \ noted the dealer's 10-upcard advantage, the aggressive Hit action violated the\
    \ **structural efficiency** principle:  \n1. **Bust Probability Miscalculation**:\
    \ With 3 cards totaling 23, drawing any 9-K (9/13 chance ≈69%) would bust. The\
    \ \"never hit 24+ with 4+ cards\" rule should have been extended preemptively\
    \ to avoid 4-card scenarios.  \n2. **Tiebreaker Neglect**: Achieving 27-30 with\
    \ 4 cards (as occurred with the final CK draw to 33→bust) offers no tiebreaker\
    \ advantage against the dealer’s likely 2-3 card 27+ hands.  \n3. **Dealer Strength\
    \ Underestimation**: The dealer’s Q-upcard (10) gave them strong 27+ potential\
    \ (e.g., hidden 8 → 18 → draw J for 28/3 cards), making the player’s 23 too weak\
    \ to justify 4-card risk.  \n\nThe loss stemmed from misapplied aggression - chasing\
    \ marginal total gains with high card counts contradicted the revised strategy\
    \ prioritizing \"28/2 > 30/4\" structural efficiency. Correct play would require\
    \ Standing at 23/3 to force the dealer to make multiple draws, capitalizing on\
    \ their high bust probability despite the low initial total.\n\n    Following\
    \ the previous rigorous analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n\
    \    Behavoiral Guidelines and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about\
    \ what\n    you consider to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral strategy\
    \ and\n    suggestions. World Modeling is about the description of the game and\
    \ the dealer.\n\n    Here are some suggestions for you:\n\n    Behavoiral Guideline\n\
    \        1-Goal: Please summarize the detailed goal based on your reflection ...\n\
    \        2-Strategy: What kind of strategy can lead you to win in similar games\

    \ Behavoiral Guideline:\n    **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Maximize\
    \ survivorship *and card efficiency* by optimizing both total proximity to 31\
    \ *and hand structure* to exploit tiebreakers. Prioritize totals ≥27 with ≤2 cards\
    \ over higher-risk multi-card hands.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Stand Thresholds**:\
    \  \n     - **Stand immediately at 31 regardless of card count** (unbeatable unless\
    \ dealer matches with ≤2 cards).  \n     - **Stand at 27+ with 2 cards** (forces\
    \ dealer to match with 2 cards or bust).  \n     - **Never hit 24+ with 4+ cards**\
    \ (bust risk >50% outweighs tiebreaker advantages).  \n   - **Aggression Limits**:\
    \  \n     - Chase 31 *only* with soft hands (e.g., A+10 → 21 allows safe 10-point\
    \ draws).  \n     - Treat 3+ card hands as rigid—prioritize survivorship over\
    \ marginal total gains.  \n   - **Tiebreaker Optimization**: Actively avoid 27-30\
    \ with 3+ cards if dealer’s upcard ≤6 (they likely need 3+ cards to reach 27+,\
    \ giving you tiebreaker advantage).  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game\
    \ as a *procedural win*:  \n   - Achieving 31 with 3 cards was correct (unbeatable\
