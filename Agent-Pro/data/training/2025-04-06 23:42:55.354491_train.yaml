    \ contradiction. While the final result showed a win (player 30 vs dealer 29),\
    \ the reflection request assumes a loss, revealing inconsistencies in scenario\
    \ setup. Key issues include:  \n1. **Threshold Overreach**: Aggressive Hitting\
    \ at 22 (10+6+6) carried a 69% bust risk (needing ≤9), yet the action was justified\
    \ by underestimating compound bust probabilities in 4-card hands.  \n2. **Dealer\
    \ Misread**: While correctly identifying the dealer’s low initial total (5 + hidden\
    \ ≤15), the World-Belief overlooked that dealers chasing 27+ from 15 achieve non-bust\
    \ totals 41% of time (via 12-16 value draws), creating parity risks.  \n3. **Rule\
    \ Misalignment**: The final result (\"win\") contradicts the reflection premise\
    \ (\"losing game\"), suggesting either data corruption or failure to recognize\
    \ dealer’s actual 29 vs player 30 outcome.  \n\nThe core failure lies in the scenario’s\
    \ inconsistent framing, not strategic execution – proper threshold aggression\
    \ (Hit→22→30) worked as intended against dealer 29. This highlights the danger\
    \ of misaligned world modeling between practice and post-game analysis.\n\n  \
    \  Following the previous rigorous analysis, you should distill and articulate\

    \ initial totals.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Hand-Size Threshold Modulation**:\
    \  \n     - 3-card hands: Stand at 27+ vs 5-6 upcards (was 26), 28+ vs 7-upcards\
    \ with suspected 17+ initial totals  \n     - 4-card hands: Auto-stand at 29+\

    \  \n     - If dealer’s estimated initial total ≤16, add +1 to baseline thresholds\
    \ for every 3 cards in player’s hand  \n     - Cap aggression at 4-card hands\
    \ – maximum 1 hit allowed after 3 cards  \n   - **Parity Prevention**:  \n   \
    \  - Prioritize totals ≥28 when dealer upcard ≤7 – blocks dealer’s 27-28 ambush\
    \ from low initial totals  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve as *Low Upcard Aggression\
