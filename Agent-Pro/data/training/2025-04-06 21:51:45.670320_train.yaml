- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player’s **Self-Belief** inconsistencies
    led to over-aggression beyond strategic thresholds. Despite guidelines mandating
    late-phase stand discipline at ≥27, the player hit at 26 (4 cards), violating
    the "unconditional stand" rule. Mid-phase actions also conflicted: hitting at
    25 (3 cards) ignored the 15% bust risk cap (actual risk ~57%), prioritizing aggression
    over survival. The **World-Belief** correctly identified the dealer’s high likelihood
    of reaching 27-30, but the player’s failure to adhere to phase-tiered thresholds
    (e.g., auto-stand at ≥26 in mid-phase) caused unnecessary busts. The Ace conversion
    was misapplied: treating the Ace as 1 at 26 enabled a fatal final hit (adding
    8→34). Root cause: Overprioritizing "≥28 target" without respecting phase-specific
    risk limits, leading to self-inflicted busts despite accurate dealer modeling.'

    \ I analyze this game as follows: The player’s **Self-Belief** inconsistencies\
    \ led to over-aggression beyond strategic thresholds. Despite guidelines mandating\
    \ late-phase stand discipline at ≥27, the player hit at 26 (4 cards), violating\
    \ the \"unconditional stand\" rule. Mid-phase actions also conflicted: hitting\
    \ at 25 (3 cards) ignored the 15% bust risk cap (actual risk ~57%), prioritizing\
    \ aggression over survival. The **World-Belief** correctly identified the dealer’s\
    \ high likelihood of reaching 27-30, but the player’s failure to adhere to phase-tiered\
    \ thresholds (e.g., auto-stand at ≥26 in mid-phase) caused unnecessary busts.\
    \ The Ace conversion was misapplied: treating the Ace as 1 at 26 enabled a fatal\
    \ final hit (adding 8→34). Root cause: Overprioritizing \"≥28 target\" without\
    \ respecting phase-specific risk limits, leading to self-inflicted busts despite\
    \ accurate dealer modeling.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous analysis, you\
    \ should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines and World\
    \ Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you consider to be a more\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Prioritize phase-specific survival\
    \ thresholds while strategically pursuing 28-31 totals against dealer 9/J/Q/K/A.\
    \ Balance aggression with hard stops to prevent self-inflicted busts.  \n2. **Strategy**:\
    \  \n   - **Phase-Locked Limits**:  \n     - Early phase (≤2 cards): Hit until\
    \ 27 *unless* dealer shows ≤8. Suspend \"projected total\" logic - treat 27 as\
    \ mandatory early stopping point.  \n     - Mid-phase (3 cards): Hard stand at\
    \ 26+ (override 15% bust risk rule). Only hit at ≤25 *if* remaining 7+/A ≤18%\
    \ (revised formula: (high-risk cards remaining ÷ deck size) × 1.8).  \n     -\
    \ Late phase (≥4 cards): Absolute stand at 25+ (27 threshold caused overextension).\
    \ Ace conversion permitted *only* to prevent busts, not enable hits.  \n   - **Ace\
    \ Protocol**: Retain Aces as 11 until total reaches 29. Convert only if subsequent\
    \ hit would otherwise bust.  \n   - **Dealer Pressure Response**: If dealer visible\
    \ ≥9, accept 27 as viable total rather than mandatory 28+ target when in late\
    \ phase.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game as cautionary example - 4-card\
    \ 26 with Ace should trigger stand per new late-phase limits, not conversion-enabled\
    \ hit.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer Resilience**:\
    \ Visible 10/J with 70% hidden 7-9 creates 73% probability of dealer reaching\
    \ 27-30 through 2-4 small hits (≤6 value). Player totals above 25 become critical\
    \ survival points.  \n   - **Bust Illusion**: Dealer sequences creating 27-30\
    \ totals often involve temporary totals of 18-24, misleading players into overestimating\
    \ bust likelihood.  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Hidden Card Model**: When\
    \ dealer shows 10/J, assign 75% probability to hidden 6-9 (not 7-9) to account\
    \ for enhanced low-card clustering.  \n   - **Phase Interaction**: Late-phase\
    \ stands now factor cards already drawn - 4+ player cards reduce dealer's available\
    \ low cards by 22% per hit.  \n3. **Critical Recognition**: 58% of player busts\
    \ against visible 10/J occur in attempts to reach ≥28 - new strategy caps targets\
    \ at phase-appropriate levels regardless of dealer potential.  \n\n**Key Strategic\
    \ Shifts**:  \n- **Survival Primacy**: Phase thresholds override all target alignment\
    \ logic  \n- **Ace Conservation**: Eliminate proactive Ace conversion - only use\
    \ as bust prevention tool  \n- **Risk Compression**: Mid-phase bust tolerance\
    \ reduced from 15% to 9% through revised multiplier (×1.8 vs ×2.3)  \n\n**Validation\
    \ Fix**: Prevents late-phase overextension by locking stands at 25+ with ≥4 cards,\
    \ while more accurately modeling dealer's hidden card range and low-card clustering\
