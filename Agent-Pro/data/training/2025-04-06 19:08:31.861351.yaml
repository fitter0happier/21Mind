    \ Limits**:  \n     - Only chase totals >27 if achievable with ≤2 cards (e.g.,\
    \ 21→28 via 7).  \n     - Treat 4+ card hands as inflexible—prioritize immediate\
    \ survival over dealer bust potential.  \n   - **Tie Mitigation**: Avoid reaching\

    \ **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer Path Dependency**:\
    \ Dealers with hidden cards ≤18 (e.g., 9+9=18) will draw 2+ times, creating bust\
    \ cascades (18→28→bust) or safe stops (18→28→31).  \n   - **Tie Inevitability**:\
    \ If dealer’s hidden card creates a starting total of 18-26, they will *always*\
    \ reach 27-31 unless they bust. Player totals of 27+ guarantee ties unless dealer\
    \ busts.  \n   - **Card Count Impact**: Dealers holding 2-card 27s (e.g., 9+18)\
    \ automatically tie player 27s, while 3+ card 27s are player losses (dealer wins\
    \ same totals with fewer cards).  \n\n**Policy Update**  \n- **Previous Guideline**:\
