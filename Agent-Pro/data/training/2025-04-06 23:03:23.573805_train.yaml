    \ identified the need to reach 27-30 aggressively, but failed to adjust when totals\
    \ entered critical bust-risk zones (24/25). The **World-Belief** accurately recognized\
    \ the dealer’s forced-hit obligation with a Diamond 2 upcard but underestimated\
    \ the self-destructive impact of over-hitting.  \n\n**Key issues**:  \n1. **Over-aggression\
    \ at high totals**: Hitting at 24 (5+J+9) and 25 (with Ace as 1) ignored the 52-62%\
    \ bust probability for totals ≥24, violating the \"Post-27 Risk Grading\" strategy.\
    \  \n2. **Misapplied threshold logic**: The 27-30 target became unachievable after\
    \ the third card (24 total), yet the player continued hitting, prioritizing theoretical\
    \ margins over survival.  \n3. **Dealer dynamics misread**: While the dealer’s\
    \ 2 upcard implied high bust potential, the player’s own bust (33) negated this\
    \ advantage, as per **Tiebreaker Nullification** rules (player busts lose regardless\
    \ of dealer outcomes).  \n\n**Root cause**: The aggressive strategy neglected\
    \ phase transitions – after exceeding 23, the risk/reward ratio flipped unfavorably.\
    \ The \"Breadth-of-Survival Doctrine\" should have triggered stand directives\
    \ at 24 against low upcards, as dealer bust probability (≈45%) outweighed the\
    \ player’s own 65% bust risk when hitting from 24."

    \ Reflection: I analyze this game as follows:  \nThe player's **Self-Belief**\
    \ correctly identified the need to reach 27-30 aggressively, but failed to adjust\
    \ when totals entered critical bust-risk zones (24/25). The **World-Belief** accurately\
    \ recognized the dealer’s forced-hit obligation with a Diamond 2 upcard but underestimated\
    \ the self-destructive impact of over-hitting.  \n\n**Key issues**:  \n1. **Over-aggression\
    \ at high totals**: Hitting at 24 (5+J+9) and 25 (with Ace as 1) ignored the 52-62%\
    \ bust probability for totals ≥24, violating the \"Post-27 Risk Grading\" strategy.\
    \  \n2. **Misapplied threshold logic**: The 27-30 target became unachievable after\
    \ the third card (24 total), yet the player continued hitting, prioritizing theoretical\
    \ margins over survival.  \n3. **Dealer dynamics misread**: While the dealer’s\
    \ 2 upcard implied high bust potential, the player’s own bust (33) negated this\
    \ advantage, as per **Tiebreaker Nullification** rules (player busts lose regardless\
    \ of dealer outcomes).  \n\n**Root cause**: The aggressive strategy neglected\
    \ phase transitions – after exceeding 23, the risk/reward ratio flipped unfavorably.\
    \ The \"Breadth-of-Survival Doctrine\" should have triggered stand directives\
    \ at 24 against low upcards, as dealer bust probability (≈45%) outweighed the\
    \ player’s own 65% bust risk when hitting from 24.\n\n    Following the previous\
    \ rigorous analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral\
    \ Guidelines and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Balance aggressive growth with\
    \ survival prioritization by dynamically adjusting target thresholds based on\
    \ phase transitions. Pursue 27-30 only when achievable with ≤65% bust risk, while\
    \ preserving existing totals ≥24 against low upcards (2-6) to exploit dealer’s\
    \ forced-hit obligations.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase-Transition Protocol**:\
    \  \n     - At 24-26 totals: Stand against upcards 2-6 (dealer bust prob. 45-52%)\
    \ unless Ace remains flexible  \n     - At 27-30: Stand universally against upcards\
    \ 7-K, stand against 2-6 only if hidden high-card prob. <35%  \n   - **Ace Elasticity\
    \ Management**:  \n     - Keep Ace as 11 until total reaches 28, then auto-convert\
    \ to 1 if subsequent hit risks >31  \n     - Prohibit hitting on soft 27+ (Ace+16)\
    \ to avoid dead-end conversions  \n   - **Bust Probability Firewalls**:  \n  \
    \   - Cease hitting at 24+ against low upcards (2-6) – dealer’s 47% avg bust chance\
    \ outweighs 62% player bust risk when hitting  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve\
    \ this game as *Overreach Cascade Exemplar* – illustrates catastrophic value destruction\
    \ when violating phase-transition limits (hitting at 24/25 against upcard 2),\
    \ despite favorable dealer dynamics.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Immediate Bust Supremacy**: Player busts lose instantly regardless\
    \ of dealer’s subsequent result – survival becomes absolute priority past 23 total\
    \  \n   - **Dealer Hit Momentum**: Low upcards (2-6) create compounding bust risk\
    \ (each forced hit adds 28-33% bust probability per card) but require player survival\
    \ to capitalize  \n   - **Ace Conversion Irreversibility**: Post-conversion rigidity\
    \ transforms strategic landscape – soft totals below 28 must preserve Ace flexibility\
    \  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Bust-Adjusted Thresholds**:  \n     - Upcard\
    \ 2-6: Stand at 24+ (dealer bust 45% vs player hit bust 62%)  \n     - Upcard\
    \ 7-9: Stand at 27+ (dealer bust 38% vs player hit bust 55%)  \n     - Upcard\
    \ 10-K: Stand at 26+ (dealer bust 58% vs player hit bust 68%)  \n   - **Deck-State\
    \ Integration**:  \n     - Track remaining low cards (2-6) – density <18% triggers\
    \ conservative stands at 24+ against upcards 2-6  \n3. **Strategic Calibration**:\
    \  \n   - **Survival Matrix**:  \n     - Upcard 2-6: 24+ (phase-transition anchor)\
    \  \n     - Upcard 7-9: 27+ (volatility hedge)  \n     - Upcard 10-K: 26+ (bust\
