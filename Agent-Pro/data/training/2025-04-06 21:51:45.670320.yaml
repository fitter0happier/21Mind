    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\
    \ hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit until their cards\
    \ total 27 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Spade J}. The dealer has\

    \ totals ≥28 against dealer visible 9/J/Q/K/A through phased aggression, prioritizing\
    \ survival via late-phase stand discipline while maintaining pressure on dealer\
    \ mid-range optimization.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase-Tiered Thresholds**:\
    \  \n     - Early phase (≤2 cards): Hit aggressively if total ≤26 *and* dealer\
    \ visible ≤10. Projected total ≥27 required when dealer shows 9+.  \n     - Mid-phase\
    \ (3 cards): Hit only if total ≤25 *and* bust risk ≤15% (revised formula: (remaining\
    \ 7+/A ÷ total) × 2.3). Auto-stand at ≥26 vs visible 10+.  \n     - Late phase\
    \ (≥4 cards): Stand unconditionally at ≥27 (prevents over-extension) *unless*\
    \ dealer visible ≤6 *and* deck high-card density <20%.  \n   - **Ace Elasticity**:\
    \ Treat Aces as 11 until total ≥28, then convert oldest Ace to 1 to enable safe\
    \ hits (e.g., 28 → A=1 allows +3 without bust).  \n   - **Dealer Target Alignment**:\
    \ If dealer visible ≥9, treat 28 as minimum target (countering their 27-30 range).\
    \  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game to illustrate late-phase stand discipline\
    \ at 30 vs dealer 9, avoiding unnecessary risk despite phase elasticity allowances.\n\
    World modeling: **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer Multi-Hit\
    \ Capability**: Visible 9 with hidden 7-9 (68% probability) lets dealers safely\
    \ take 2-3 hits (9+7→16→hit→+5→21→hit→+6→27), reducing perceived bust risk through\
    \ sequential low draws.  \n   - **Cluster Carryover Effect**: Each dealer hit\
    \ reshuffles high-card density assumptions - visible 9 games have 22% higher chance\
    \ of dealer drawing consecutive ≤6 cards than other scenarios.  \n2. **Policy\
    \ Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: Model hidden 7-9 at 60% → **Revised**: \"When\
    \ dealer shows 9, assign 70% probability to hidden 7-9 and 25% to 10/A.\"  \n\
    \   - **Previous**: Late-phase stand at 25 → **Revised**: \"Late-phase dynamic\
    \ floor = max(27, dealer_visible + 18)\" (e.g., 9 → floor 27).  \n3. **Critical\
    \ Recognition**: Dealers achieve 27-30 in 62% of visible 9 scenarios through sequential\
    \ small hits, making player totals of 28-31 critical despite apparent bust risks.\
    \  \n\n**Key Strategic Shifts**:  \n- **Ace Conversion Protocol**: Systematically\
    \ reduce Aces from 11→1 when exceeding 27 to enable controlled aggression.  \n\
    - **Density-Weighted Bust Calculus**: Apply variable multipliers (×2.0-×2.5) based\
    \ on recent card trends rather than static values.  \n- **Floor Anchoring**: Bind\
    \ stand thresholds to dealer visible card via linear formulas rather than fixed\
    \ numbers.  \n\n**Validation Fix**: Corrects prior over-aggression in late phases\
    \ by hard-coding 27 as minimum stand against dealer 9+, while introducing Ace\
    \ flexibility to safely pursue 28-31.\nPlease read the behavioral guideline and\
    \ world modeling carefully. Then you should analyze your own cards and your strategies\
