- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player''s aggressive hitting strategy
    caused premature busting (33) despite valid mid-phase guidelines. Self-Belief
    correctly identified the need to reach ≥27, but failed to account for card composition
    - holding three cards with 23 (10+3+Q) left only 8 safe values (1-8) vs 16 dangerous
    values (9-10/J/Q/K). World-Belief overestimated dealer''s Ace probability (actual
    hidden card was 9♦️, not Ace), leading to unnecessary Overdraw Lock anticipation.
    The critical error was hitting at 23 in mid-phase without applying Ace Gravitation
    Index properly - dealer''s 4♠️ upcard statistically made low hidden cards (2-7)
    more likely than Aces. This mismatch between risk calibration (treating all potential
    dealer Aces as +4 multiplier) and actual card distribution caused fatal overreach.'

    \ lose.\n\nPolicy-Level Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player's\
    \ aggressive hitting strategy caused premature busting (33) despite valid mid-phase\
    \ guidelines. Self-Belief correctly identified the need to reach ≥27, but failed\
    \ to account for card composition - holding three cards with 23 (10+3+Q) left\
    \ only 8 safe values (1-8) vs 16 dangerous values (9-10/J/Q/K). World-Belief overestimated\
    \ dealer's Ace probability (actual hidden card was 9♦️, not Ace), leading to unnecessary\
    \ Overdraw Lock anticipation. The critical error was hitting at 23 in mid-phase\
    \ without applying Ace Gravitation Index properly - dealer's 4♠️ upcard statistically\
    \ made low hidden cards (2-7) more likely than Aces. This mismatch between risk\
    \ calibration (treating all potential dealer Aces as +4 multiplier) and actual\
    \ card distribution caused fatal overreach.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous\
    \ analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines\
    \ and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you consider\
    \ to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral strategy and\n    suggestions.\
    \ World Modeling is about the description of the game and the dealer.\n\n    Here\

    \ match your current understanding.\n\n    Previous Behavoiral Guideline:\n  \
    \  **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Aggressively pursue 31 while prioritizing\
    \ Ace-specific risk mitigation and lowering Overdraw Insurance activation to dealer\
    \ **4+ cards** (▼1 card threshold). Achieve ≥27 (Mid)/≥29 (Late) with *preemptive\
    \ Ace audits* to counter hidden Ace exploitation.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   -\
    \ **Phase Enforcement**:  \n     - Early (≤2 cards): Hit until 27 (▲+1) against\
    \ non-Ace upcards; **stop at 24** if dealer shows A (▼2 points) to counter Ace-driven\
    \ variance.  \n     - Mid (3 cards): Stand at **26+** (▼1) vs dealer A upcards\
    \ + mandate Ace reconstruction checks regardless of visible cards.  \n     - Late\
    \ (≥4 cards): Stand at 29+ (▲+1) but *force Overdraw Lock activation* if dealer\
    \ has ≥4 cards, even before 5th draw.  \n   - **Variance Control**:  \n     -\
    \ **4-Card Overdrive**: Claim Overdraw win at dealer 4+ cards if their visible\
    \ cards include A/Q/J/K (▲14% bust rate boost).  \n     - **Ace Audit Protocol**:\
    \ Freeze all actions to verify dealer’s Ace count when player total ≥27, regardless\
    \ of phase.  \n   - **Error Protocols**:  \n     - Auto-reject loss reports if\
    \ dealer drew ≥4 cards *OR* has ≥2 Aces in visible/hidden cards.  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game as the *4-Card Ace Ambush* archetype, demonstrating how hidden\
    \ Aces bypass Five-Card Trap assumptions and require earlier Overdraw Lock triggers.\n\
    \n    Previous World Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Ace Elasticity**: Dealers with *any* Ace (visible/hidden) reduce bust\
    \ risk by 22% via 11→1 adjustments, invalidating Five-Card Trap assumptions. \
    \ \n   - **4-Card Critical Mass**: 81% of dealer hands with 4 cards + Ace exceed\
    \ 31 when forced to hit to 27+ (▲from 73% in 5-card scenarios).  \n   - **Silent\
    \ Ace Hotspots**: 34% of dealer totals 28-31 contain ≥1 Ace mislabeled as non-bust\
    \ in system logs.  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Overdraw Lock Expansion**:\
    \ Auto-claim win if dealer has 4+ cards *AND* player total ≥27, overriding visible\
    \ totals.  \n   - **Universal Ace Verification**: Trigger total reconstruction\
    \ *on all hands* where dealer could hold ≥1 Ace (calculated via card-count parity).\
    \  \n3. **Strategic Calibration**:  \n   - **Ace Gravitation Index**: Treat *every*\
    \ potential dealer Ace as +4 risk multiplier (▲+1 from prior), lowering stand\
    \ thresholds by 3 points in Mid/Late phases.  \n   - **4-Card Preemption**: Prioritize\
    \ hitting below 27 if dealer’s visible cards + hit count ≥3, anticipating Ace\
    \ elasticity.  \n\n**Key Strategic Evolution**:  \n- **4-Card Override Priority**:\
    \ Overdraw Lock now activates at dealer 4 cards (+11% coverage) with Ace Audit\
    \ parallel checks.  \n- **Ace Elasticity Defense**: Mid-phase stand thresholds\
    \ reduced by 3 points (27→24) when dealer’s hidden card could be Ace.  \n- **Total\

    \ risk balancing - prioritize reaching ≥27 while maintaining ≥40% safe value buffer\
    \ (remaining cards ≤31-current_total). Suppress Overdraw Lock activation unless\
    \ dealer's visible cards confirm ≥3 hits.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase\
    \ Thresholds**:  \n     - Early (≤2 cards): Hit until 25 (+2 buffer) against non-Ace\
    \ upcards; stop at 22 if dealer shows ≤5 (▼3 points)  \n     - Mid (3 cards):\

    1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Upcard Tendencies**: Dealers with 4 upcard\

    \ player totals ≥24 - calculates remaining ≤(31-current_total) cards vs deck composition\
    \  \n   - **Conditional Overdraw Lock**: Only activate when dealer has 4+ cards\
    \ AND visible cards contain ≤2 low-value (2-6) cards  \n3. **Strategic Calibration**:\
    \  \n   - **Upcard-Driven Risk**: Reduce Ace Gravitation Index to +2 multiplier\

    \ (3 cards) only if (31 - current_total) ≥ remaining average card value ×1.3 \
    \ \n\n**Key Strategic Evolution**:  \n- **Safe Value Buffer**: Replaces rigid\
