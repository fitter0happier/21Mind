    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\

    \ Hit until 27 (▲+1) against non-Ace upcards; **stop at 24** if dealer shows A\
    \ (▼2 points) to counter Ace-driven variance.  \n     - Mid (3 cards): Stand at\

    \ *on all hands* where dealer could hold ≥1 Ace (calculated via card-count parity).\
    \  \n3. **Strategic Calibration**:  \n   - **Ace Gravitation Index**: Treat *every*\
    \ potential dealer Ace as +4 risk multiplier (▲+1 from prior), lowering stand\
    \ thresholds by 3 points in Mid/Late phases.  \n   - **4-Card Preemption**: Prioritize\
