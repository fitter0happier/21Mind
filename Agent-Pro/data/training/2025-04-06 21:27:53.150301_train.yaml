- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The loss stemmed from variance rather
    than strategic error. Self-Beliefs were consistent: hitting until reaching 25
    aligned with the ≥24 threshold for the dealer’s visible J (10). World-Belief correctly
    anticipated dealers needing 2+ hits to reach 27 from hidden 9/10 scenarios. However,
    the dealer’s actual hidden card (CT, 10) and subsequent Ace draw (SA, 11) created
    an edge case where they reached 31 in one hit. The strategy’s flaw lies in assuming
    forced multi-hit dealer scenarios would *always* amplify bust risk, but failed
    to account for rare high-value card sequences (e.g., 10 → Ace) that let dealers
    leap directly to safe totals. This reflects a limitation in probability-based
    guidelines when extreme card distributions occur.'

    \ hidden card (CT, 10) and subsequent Ace draw (SA, 11) created an edge case where\
    \ they reached 31 in one hit. The strategy’s flaw lies in assuming forced multi-hit\
    \ dealer scenarios would *always* amplify bust risk, but failed to account for\
    \ rare high-value card sequences (e.g., 10 → Ace) that let dealers leap directly\

    \ Surge Control**: Accept controlled failure rates (<5%) from dealer high-card\
