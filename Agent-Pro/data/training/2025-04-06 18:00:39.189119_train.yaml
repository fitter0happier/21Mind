- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player followed the strategy correctly
    (Stand at 25+ with 3+ cards against dealer’s 9) and avoided busting. However,
    the dealer’s hidden card (H2) created a low starting total (9+2=11), forcing them
    to hit until reaching 27. This resulted in a draw (player 27 vs. dealer 27), which
    aligns with the final results. The problematic belief was underestimating the
    dealer’s ability to reach exactly 27 without busting. The dealer’s forced hits
    (11→18→27) neutralized the player’s survivorship advantage, highlighting a limitation
    in the strategy: standing at 27 guarantees survival but cannot force a win if
    the dealer matches the total. The core issue stems from rule asymmetry—dealers
    aren’t required to beat the player, only to reach 27, making ties inevitable in
    some scenarios despite optimal play.'

    \ [''C6'', ''SA'', ''DK''], '\n  final results: draw.\n\nPolicy-Level Reflection:\
    \ I analyze this game as follows: The player followed the strategy correctly (Stand\
    \ at 25+ with 3+ cards against dealer’s 9) and avoided busting. However, the dealer’s\
    \ hidden card (H2) created a low starting total (9+2=11), forcing them to hit\
    \ until reaching 27. This resulted in a draw (player 27 vs. dealer 27), which\
    \ aligns with the final results. The problematic belief was underestimating the\
    \ dealer’s ability to reach exactly 27 without busting. The dealer’s forced hits\
    \ (11→18→27) neutralized the player’s survivorship advantage, highlighting a limitation\
    \ in the strategy: standing at 27 guarantees survival but cannot force a win if\
    \ the dealer matches the total. The core issue stems from rule asymmetry—dealers\
    \ aren’t required to beat the player, only to reach 27, making ties inevitable\
    \ in some scenarios despite optimal play.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous\
    \ analysis, you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines\
    \ and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you consider\
    \ to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral strategy and\n    suggestions.\
    \ World Modeling is about the description of the game and the dealer.\n\n    Here\
    \ are some suggestions for you:\n\n    Behavoiral Guideline\n        1-Goal: Please\
    \ summarize the detailed goal based on your reflection ...\n        2-Strategy:\
    \ What kind of strategy can lead you to win in similar games ...\n        3-Demonstration:\
    \ Can this game be considered a typical example to be preserved for\n        future\
    \ reference ...\n    World Modeling\n        1-Rule-Description: Based on the\
    \ recent reflection , describe any game rules or details\n        that are easy\
    \ to overlook ...\n\n\n    Update previous policies that you used to have to better\
    \ match your current understanding.\n\n    Previous Behavoiral Guideline:\n  \
    \  **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Maximize win probability by strategically\
    \ balancing aggression and survival. Prioritize avoiding immediate busts (which\
    \ cause instant loss) over chasing marginal gains, especially against high dealer\
    \ cards (7-10). Force the dealer into risky draws by surviving to their turn.\
    \  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Stand Thresholds**:  \n     - **Stand at 25+ with\
    \ 3+ cards** against dealer 7-10 (reduced bust flexibility in multi-card hands).\
    \  \n     - **Stand at 26+ with 2-card hands** against dealer 7-10 (acknowledge\
    \ 60%+ bust risk from 7-K cards).  \n     - **Stand at 24+** against dealer ≤6\
    \ (exploit dealer’s need for large draws).  \n   - **Hand Flexibility**: Favor\
    \ standing earlier with 3+ cards (e.g., 25 with 3 cards = stand) due to limited\
    \ bust-avoidance options.  \n   - **Deck Awareness**: If ≥40% of remaining cards\
    \ are 7-K, avoid hitting at 24+ against high dealer cards.  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game to illustrate:  \n   - Standing at 25 (3-card hand) against\
    \ dealer 8 avoids ~54% bust risk and exploits dealer’s forced hits.  \n   - Survivorship\
    \ bias: Players must stay alive to benefit from dealer bust cascades.  \n\n---\n\
    \n    Previous World Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Bust-Order Asymmetry**: Player busts end the game immediately; dealer\
    \ busts only matter if the player survives.  \n   - **Dealer Forced Action**:\
    \ Dealers *must* hit until ≥27, even if their hidden card creates a vulnerable\
    \ total (e.g., 8+9=17 → dealer keeps hitting).  \n   - **Cascade Bust Potential**:\
    \ Dealers with low hidden totals (e.g., 8+9=17) risk multi-draw busts (17→27→37)\
    \ but require the player to survive to capitalize on this.  \n   - **High-Value\
    \ Saturation**: 7-K constitute ~46% of card values (6/13), making hits at 24+\
    \ inherently risky.  \n\n**Policy Update**  \n- **Previous Guideline**: \"Hit\
    \ ≤25 against high dealer cards\" → **Revised**: \"Stand at 25+ with 3+ cards\
    \ against dealer 7-10; hit only 24-25 with 2-card hands.\"  \n- **Previous World\
    \ Model**: Underestimated dealer’s vulnerability to forced bust cascades → **Revised**:\
    \ Explicitly model dealer’s mandatory hits as a survivorship lever.  \n\n--- \
    \ \n**Key Strategic Shift**:  \nAggression is *conditional*: High totals (25+)\
    \ with limited flexibility (3+ cards) warrant standing against strong dealer cards.\
    \ Forcing the dealer to draw 2+ cards amplifies their bust risk, but only if the\
    \ player survives to witness it.\n    "

    **World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer Stop Condition**:\
    \ Dealers halt at *exactly* 27, not 27+. This creates tie potential when player\
    \ totals equal 27.  \n   - **Tie Mechanics**: If both player and dealer reach\
    \ 27-31 without busting, the game is a draw, even if the dealer’s total matches\

    \ (e.g., 9+2=11) must hit until ≥27, which can result in either bust cascades\
    \ (11→21→31→bust) or safe stops (11→21→27).  \n   - **Bust-Tie Tradeoff**: Player\
    \ survival guarantees dealer action but not victory—aggression must avoid crossing\
    \ into tie-inducing totals unless necessary.  \n\n**Policy Update**  \n- **Previous\
    \ Guideline**: \"Stand at 25+ with 3+ cards\" → **Revised**: \"Stand at 25+ with\

    \ Strategic Shift**:  \nAggression must *avoid creating ties* when possible. Survivorship\
    \ remains paramount, but players should aim for totals *above 27* (if safely achievable)\
    \ to beat dealer stops at 27. Since hitting beyond 27 risks bust, strategic standing\
    \ at 25-26 with 3+ cards becomes critical to pressure dealers into multi-draw\
    \ busts *while avoiding tie traps*."
