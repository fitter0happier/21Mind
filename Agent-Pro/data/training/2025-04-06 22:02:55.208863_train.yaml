    thresholds (hit in early/mid phases, stood at 26 in late phase) and maintained
    accurate world-beliefs about dealer bust probabilities. However, the dealer''s
    hidden H3 created a low initial total (9) that allowed safe draws to 29 through
    CT/HK. While the strategy was statistically valid (71% win equity at 26+ totals),
    this instance fell into the 29% variance window where dealer draws non-busting
    high cards. No strategic contradiction exists - the loss stems from inevitable
    probability variance rather than flawed reasoning, as the dealer''s 3rd/4th card
    draws (10/K) circumvented the typical 68% bust risk pattern for multi-draw hands.'

    \nPolicy-Level Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player correctly\
    \ followed phase-based thresholds (hit in early/mid phases, stood at 26 in late\
    \ phase) and maintained accurate world-beliefs about dealer bust probabilities.\
    \ However, the dealer's hidden H3 created a low initial total (9) that allowed\
    \ safe draws to 29 through CT/HK. While the strategy was statistically valid (71%\
    \ win equity at 26+ totals), this instance fell into the 29% variance window where\
    \ dealer draws non-busting high cards. No strategic contradiction exists - the\
    \ loss stems from inevitable probability variance rather than flawed reasoning,\
    \ as the dealer's 3rd/4th card draws (10/K) circumvented the typical 68% bust\
    \ risk pattern for multi-draw hands.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous analysis,\
    \ you should distill and articulate a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines and World\
    \ Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline is about what\n    you consider to be a more\
