- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player''s aggressive strategy led
    to a critical error when hitting on 26. With a 69% chance of busting (needing
    ≤5), the risk far outweighed the reward. The Self-Belief incorrectly prioritized
    chasing 31 over survival, ignoring the low probability of safe draws. The World-Belief
    accurately noted the dealer’s obligation to hit until 27+, but failed to weigh
    that the dealer’s potential bust chance (from their own draws) was more favorable
    than the player’s self-imposed 31% survival odds. The inconsistency lay in assuming
    dealer bust likelihood justified self-endangerment, while mathematically, standing
    at 26 offered better expected value (forcing dealer to risk busting) than accepting
    near-certain defeat by hitting. The loss stemmed from overestimating the value
    of reaching 27-31 against the dealer’s mandatory hits, rather than minimizing
    personal risk.'

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Prioritize avoiding busting while\
    \ maintaining a total (24-30) that forces the dealer to risk busting to reach\
    \ their 27+ requirement. Winning via dealer bust is preferable to self-busting\
    \ for marginal gains.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - Stand on totals ≥25 (unless\
    \ dealer’s visible card strongly indicates they’ll reach 27+ safely).  \n   -\
    \ Hit only when current total ≤24, where a single card can safely elevate to 25-30\
    \ without busting.  \n   - Aggression shifts from chasing 31 to exploiting dealer’s\
    \ mandatory high-target weakness.  \n3. **Demonstration**: This game exemplifies\
    \ the \"stand-at-25+\" principle when dealer must hit aggressively. Archive as\
    \ a caution against overestimating 31’s necessity.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n\
    1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - Dealers *must* hit until ≥27, making their bust\
    \ probability non-trivial (e.g., starting at 17 requires 10+ to reach 27, but\
    \ drawing again risks 17+10+Ace=28 vs. 17+10+9=36 bust).  \n   - Player totals\
    \ of 25-26 are critical: high enough to pressure dealer draws, low enough to avoid\
    \ self-bust.  \n   - Ace values are fixed as 11 (unlike traditional blackjack),\
    \ simplifying math but reducing flexibility.  \n\n**Policy Update**  \n- **Previous\
    \ Guideline**: \"Aggressively chase 31\" → **Revised**: \"Aggressively *position*\
    \ to 25-30, then shift risk to dealer.\"  \n- **Previous World Model**: Underestimated\
    \ dealer’s bust likelihood when player stands mid-range → **Revised**: Explicitly\
    \ model dealer’s high bust rates at 27+ thresholds."
