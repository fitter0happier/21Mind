    \ validated thresholds, prioritizing survival in 4-card hands while targeting\

    \   - 3-card hands: Hit to 28+ against Q/K upcards (was 27+) to counter dealer’s\
    \ 17-20 initial total threat  \n     - 4-card hands: **Mandatory stand at 29+**\
    \ (no exceptions), with immediate termination of aggression upon reaching threshold\
    \  \n   - **Arithmetic Supremacy Clause**:  \n     - Triple-verify totals after\
    \ every hit (upgraded from double-check) to eliminate 10% error risk  \n     -\
    \ Treat 30/31 as \"fortress totals\" – instant stand regardless of dealer upcard\
    \  \n   - **Dealer Ambush Override**:  \n     - Against Q/K upcards, assume dealer’s\
    \ hidden card creates initial 17+ total until proven otherwise through hand progression\
    \  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve *4-Card Standoff* (this game) as canonical\
    \ example: 29 total with 4 cards forced stand despite dealer’s K upcard, demonstrating\
    \ protocol adherence overrides outcome ambiguity.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n\
    1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer’s Compounding Horizon**: Dealers must\
    \ hit until reaching 27+, creating 18-23% bust risk per additional card drawn\
    \ beyond 3  \n   - **4-Card Fragility Window**: Player 4-card hands at 24-28 have\
    \ 52-68% bust risk on next hit – prohibited against Q/K upcards  \n   - **Hidden\
    \ Card Quantum Lock**: K upcard dealers have 33% probability of hidden card being\
    \ 2-7 (initial 12-17), requiring players to build ≥28 totals  \n2. **Strategic\
    \ Recognition**:  \n   - **Upcard Entanglement**:  \n     - K upcard creates dual\
    \ reality: immediate dealer stand threat (initial 20) vs delayed compounding (initial\
    \ 12-17)  \n     - Player must resolve uncertainty by reaching 28+ with ≤4 cards\
    \  \n   - **Threshold Elasticity 4.0**:  \n     - For every confirmed dealer initial\
    \ total point below 18, reduce player stand threshold by 1.0 (not 0.75) to counter\
    \ compounding acceleration  \n3. **Calibration Matrix**:  \n   - **K-Upcard Response**:\
    \ 28+ (3 cards)/29+ (4 cards) with triple total verification  \n   - **Catastrophic\
