- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player’s final cards (A, K, K = 31)
    and dealer’s bust (32) should result in a **win**, contradicting the stated "loss."
    This inconsistency suggests a possible error in the game record’s final results.
    The player’s actions followed guidelines correctly: hitting at 21 (early phase,
    0% bust risk) to reach 31 and standing was optimal. The dealer’s bust risk was
    correctly modeled. If the loss occurred despite this, it implies a misalignment
    in the game’s reported outcome, not flawed strategy. The **Self-Belief** (31 total,
    no bust risk) and **World-Belief** (dealer likely to reach 27–29) were accurate.
    The loss, as described, violates game rules, highlighting potential data entry
    errors or misinterpretation of dealer totals. Critical takeaway: Verify final
    game state integrity before attributing losses to strategic failure.'

    \ I analyze this game as follows: The player’s final cards (A, K, K = 31) and\
    \ dealer’s bust (32) should result in a **win**, contradicting the stated \"loss.\"\
    \ This inconsistency suggests a possible error in the game record’s final results.\
    \ The player’s actions followed guidelines correctly: hitting at 21 (early phase,\
    \ 0% bust risk) to reach 31 and standing was optimal. The dealer’s bust risk was\
    \ correctly modeled. If the loss occurred despite this, it implies a misalignment\
    \ in the game’s reported outcome, not flawed strategy. The **Self-Belief** (31\
    \ total, no bust risk) and **World-Belief** (dealer likely to reach 27–29) were\
    \ accurate. The loss, as described, violates game rules, highlighting potential\
    \ data entry errors or misinterpretation of dealer totals. Critical takeaway:\
    \ Verify final game state integrity before attributing losses to strategic failure.\n\
    \n    Following the previous rigorous analysis, you should distill and articulate\
    \ a set of\n    Behavoiral Guidelines and World Modeling. The Behavoiral Guideline\
    \ is about what\n    you consider to be a more reasonable and effective behavioral\
    \ strategy and\n    suggestions. World Modeling is about the description of the\
    \ game and the dealer.\n\n    Here are some suggestions for you:\n\n    Behavoiral\
    \ Guideline\n        1-Goal: Please summarize the detailed goal based on your\
    \ reflection ...\n        2-Strategy: What kind of strategy can lead you to win\
    \ in similar games ...\n        3-Demonstration: Can this game be considered a\
    \ typical example to be preserved for\n        future reference ...\n    World\

    \ any game rules or details\n        that are easy to overlook ...\n\n\n    Update\
    \ previous policies that you used to have to better match your current understanding.\n\
    \n    Previous Behavoiral Guideline:\n    **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**:\
    \ Achieve totals ≥28 through **phase-calibrated aggression**, prioritizing survival\
    \ in late-game stages. Balance reaching 28–31 against strict bust risk caps (≤55%\
    \ for ≤3 cards, ≤45% for ≥4 cards), even if standing guarantees loss.  \n2. **Strategy**:\
    \  \n   - **Phase-Locked Aggression**:  \n     - **Early Game (≤3 cards)**: Tolerate\
    \ ≤55% bust risk to reach 28+.  \n     - **Late Game (≥4 cards)**: Cap bust risk\
    \ at 45%—**stand immediately if exceeded**, regardless of dealer’s threat.  \n\
    \   - **Loss Acceptance Protocol**: If standing at sub-28 totals guarantees loss\
    \ but hitting exceeds phase bust caps, **stand and concede**—prioritize long-term\
    \ risk discipline over short-term variance.  \n   - **Threshold Adjustment**:\
    \  \n     - Against dealer 10/J/Q/K: Hit 24–27 only if bust risk ≤ phase cap.\
    \ At 28/2-3 cards, hit unless bust risk >60%.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve\
    \ this game as a **phase-compliance failure**—violating late-game 45% bust cap\
    \ (54% risk) caused avoidable bust. Highlights non-negotiable phase limits.  \n\
    \n---\n\n    Previous World Modeling:\n    **World Modeling**1. **Rule-Description**:\
    \  \n   - **Dealer’s High-Turnover Hands**:  \n     - Dealers with 10/J/Q/K upcards\
    \ reach 30–31 in 21% of cases, but **27–29 totals occur 63% of the time**—sub-28\
    \ player totals still lose >60% even if dealer doesn’t hit 30+.  \n     - **Hidden\
    \ Card Multi-Hit Potential**: Dealers averaging 2.3 additional cards after hitting\
    \ 17–26 often achieve 27–29 (e.g., Q + 7 → 17 → hit to 27 via 10).  \n   - **Bust\
    \ Probability Gradients**:  \n     - Late-game hands (≥4 cards) face steep bust\
    \ risk spikes: needing ≤3 to survive at 28/4 cards = 38% bust risk, but 28/5 cards\
    \ = 62% (needs ≤3).  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**: “Hit 24–27\
    \ vs. dealer 10+ unless bust risk >60%” → **Revised**: “Hit 24–27 only if bust\
    \ risk ≤ phase cap (55%/45%).”  \n   - **Previous**: “Favor hitting at 28/2-3\
    \ cards” → **Revised**: “At 28/2-3 cards, hit only if bust risk ≤55% (early phase)\
    \ or ≤45% (late phase).”  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic Shift**:  \n- **Phase Sovereignty**:\
    \ Late-game survival supersedes aggression—strict 45% bust cap prevents self-inflicted\

    \ guaranteed losses when hitting violates phase caps, preserving bankroll for\
    \ higher-probability hands.  \n\n---  \n**Critical Fix**: The loss exposed **phase\

- content: "**Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Achieve totals ≥28 through **strict\
    \ phase-calibrated aggression**, prioritizing survival in late-game stages while\
    \ verifying game-state integrity. Balance aggression with *absolute adherence*\
    \ to bust risk caps (≤55% for ≤3 cards, ≤45% for ≥4 cards), even if standing guarantees\
    \ loss.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase Sovereignty**:  \n     - **Early Game\
    \ (≤3 cards)**: Hit at 24–27 totals if bust risk ≤55%. At 28+ with 2-3 cards,\
    \ hit only if bust risk ≤55%.  \n     - **Late Game (≥4 cards)**: Stand if bust\
    \ risk >45%, *even if dealer threatens 30–31*.  \n   - **Outcome Validation**:\
    \ Cross-check final game states (e.g., dealer’s hidden cards, total calculations)\
    \ before attributing losses to strategy failures.  \n   - **Loss Acceptance**:\
    \ Stand at sub-28 totals if hitting violates phase caps—preserve capital for statistically\
    \ favorable hands.  \n3. **Demonstration**: Preserve this game as a **phase-compliance\
    \ success**—correctly hitting at 21 (0% bust risk) to reach 31, but flag the reported\
    \ loss as a **data integrity failure**. Highlights need to audit external game\
    \ records.  \n\n**World Modeling**  \n1. **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Dealer\
    \ Hit Dynamics**: Dealers with 10/J/Q/K upcards reach 27–29 in 63% of cases but\
    \ *require multiple hits* (avg. 2.3 cards) to do so.  \n   - **Bust Risk Gradients**:\
    \  \n     - Late-game hands (≥4 cards) face exponential bust risk: 28/4 cards\
    \ = 38% bust chance vs. 28/5 cards = 62%.  \n   - **Outcome Reporting Pitfalls**:\
    \ Game records may misreport results (e.g., labeling a win as loss)—always reconcile\
    \ dealer’s final total against rules.  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Previous**:\
    \ “Hit 24–27 vs. dealer 10+ if risk ≤ phase cap” → **Revised**: “Hit 24–27 only\
    \ if risk ≤ phase cap *and game-state tracking is reliable*.”  \n   - **Previous**:\
    \ “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%” → **Revised**: “Stand at ≥4 cards if risk >45%,\
    \ then demand dealer total verification post-game.”  \n\n---  \n**Key Strategic\
    \ Shifts**:  \n- **Integrity Over Assumption**: Strategy assumes game-state accuracy—add\
    \ validation steps to detect reporting errors.  \n- **Phase Rigidity**: Late-game\
    \ 45% cap is non-negotiable *even if dealer appears strong*—self-inflicted busts\
    \ are costlier than conceded losses.  \n\n**Critical Fix**: The misreported loss\
    \ underscores **external data risks**—updated policies treat game records as fallible\
    \ and mandate cross-verification."
