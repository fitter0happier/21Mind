    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game. Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 31 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 31, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of going over 31. \n4. After all players have completed their\
    \ hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit until their cards\
    \ total 27 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Diamond 7}. The dealer has\
    \ another hidden card. You don't know what it is. Your current cards are {Diamond\
    \ A,Club 10}. Behavioral guideline: **Behavioral Guideline**  \n1. **Goal**: Balance\
    \ aggressive growth with survival prioritization by dynamically adjusting target\
    \ thresholds based on phase transitions. Pursue 27-30 only when achievable with\
    \ ≤65% bust risk, while preserving existing totals ≥24 against low upcards (2-6)\
    \ to exploit dealer’s forced-hit obligations.  \n2. **Strategy**:  \n   - **Phase-Transition\
    \ Protocol**:  \n     - At 24-26 totals: Stand against upcards 2-6 (dealer bust\
    \ prob. 45-52%) unless Ace remains flexible  \n     - At 27-30: Stand universally\
    \ against upcards 7-K, stand against 2-6 only if hidden high-card prob. <35% \
    \ \n   - **Ace Elasticity Management**:  \n     - Keep Ace as 11 until total reaches\
    \ 28, then auto-convert to 1 if subsequent hit risks >31  \n     - Prohibit hitting\
    \ on soft 27+ (Ace+16) to avoid dead-end conversions  \n   - **Bust Probability\
    \ Firewalls**:  \n     - Cease hitting at 24+ against low upcards (2-6) – dealer’s\
    \ 47% avg bust chance outweighs 62% player bust risk when hitting  \n3. **Demonstration**:\
    \ Preserve this game as *Overreach Cascade Exemplar* – illustrates catastrophic\
    \ value destruction when violating phase-transition limits (hitting at 24/25 against\
    \ upcard 2), despite favorable dealer dynamics.\nWorld modeling: **World Modeling**1.\
    \ **Rule-Description**:  \n   - **Immediate Bust Supremacy**: Player busts lose\
    \ instantly regardless of dealer’s subsequent result – survival becomes absolute\
    \ priority past 23 total  \n   - **Dealer Hit Momentum**: Low upcards (2-6) create\
    \ compounding bust risk (each forced hit adds 28-33% bust probability per card)\
    \ but require player survival to capitalize  \n   - **Ace Conversion Irreversibility**:\
    \ Post-conversion rigidity transforms strategic landscape – soft totals below\
    \ 28 must preserve Ace flexibility  \n2. **Policy Updates**:  \n   - **Bust-Adjusted\
    \ Thresholds**:  \n     - Upcard 2-6: Stand at 24+ (dealer bust 45% vs player\
    \ hit bust 62%)  \n     - Upcard 7-9: Stand at 27+ (dealer bust 38% vs player\
    \ hit bust 55%)  \n     - Upcard 10-K: Stand at 26+ (dealer bust 58% vs player\
    \ hit bust 68%)  \n   - **Deck-State Integration**:  \n     - Track remaining\
    \ low cards (2-6) – density <18% triggers conservative stands at 24+ against upcards\
    \ 2-6  \n3. **Strategic Calibration**:  \n   - **Survival Matrix**:  \n     -\
    \ Upcard 2-6: 24+ (phase-transition anchor)  \n     - Upcard 7-9: 27+ (volatility\
    \ hedge)  \n     - Upcard 10-K: 26+ (bust leverage)  \n\n**Key Strategic Evolution**:\
    \  \n- **Phase-Transition Doctrine**: Replaces rigid 27-30 targets with dynamic\
    \ survival thresholds based on real-time risk ratios  \n- **Bust Asymmetry Internalization**:\
    \ Prioritizes preventing player busts over theoretical dealer bust potential past\
    \ 23 total  \n- **Elastic Ace Preservation**: Formalizes Ace retention protocols\
    \ to maintain strategic flexibility\nPlease read the behavioral guideline and\
