- content: 'I analyze this game as follows: The player’s final bust resulted from
    violating the **Stand Threshold** rule for 4-card hands (≥26) by hitting at 26,
    directly conflicting with the Behavioral Guideline. While the World-Belief about
    dealer high-finish probability (68% ≥27) was accurate, the Self-Belief erroneously
    prioritized chasing 28+ over adhering to the 26+/4-card stand threshold. The dealer’s
    hidden card (8) and subsequent draw (10) validated their high-finish potential,
    but the player’s inconsistency—choosing aggression despite meeting the stand criteria—caused
    an avoidable bust. The loss highlights a critical misalignment between strategy
    and action: rigid adherence to total maximization must respect predefined thresholds
    to balance survivorship. The underlying issue was overaggression in a 4-card 26
    scenario, where standing was mandatory per policy, not optional.'

    \ Reflection: I analyze this game as follows: The player’s final bust resulted\
    \ from violating the **Stand Threshold** rule for 4-card hands (≥26) by hitting\
    \ at 26, directly conflicting with the Behavioral Guideline. While the World-Belief\
    \ about dealer high-finish probability (68% ≥27) was accurate, the Self-Belief\
    \ erroneously prioritized chasing 28+ over adhering to the 26+/4-card stand threshold.\
    \ The dealer’s hidden card (8) and subsequent draw (10) validated their high-finish\
    \ potential, but the player’s inconsistency—choosing aggression despite meeting\
    \ the stand criteria—caused an avoidable bust. The loss highlights a critical\
    \ misalignment between strategy and action: rigid adherence to total maximization\
    \ must respect predefined thresholds to balance survivorship. The underlying issue\
    \ was overaggression in a 4-card 26 scenario, where standing was mandatory per\
    \ policy, not optional.\n\n    Following the previous rigorous analysis, you should\
