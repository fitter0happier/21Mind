- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 18 (8 + 10). Hitting once cannot exceed 31
    (max 18 + 13 = 31), but under standard rules, K = 10, so 18 + 12 (Q) = 30. Uncertain
    card values complicate, but aiming to improve}. World-Belief is {Dealer's total
    is 10 + hidden. They must hit until ≥27, likely ending near 27-31. Hidden card
    likely forces them to draw, risking bust}. My action is Hit.
