- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 16. Hitting once cannot exceed 31, so I can
    safely improve my total to 17-27. Standing leaves me vulnerable as the dealer
    will likely reach 27+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's Ace (11) plus hidden card requires
    them to hit until 27+. Their hidden card likely results in a starting total below
    27, forcing them to draw multiple cards and risk busting}. My action is Hit.
