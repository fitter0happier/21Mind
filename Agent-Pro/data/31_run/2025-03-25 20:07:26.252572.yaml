- content: Self-Belief is My current total is 13, which is too low. As an aggressive
    player, I must take risks to reach a competitive total closer to 31. Standing
    guarantees a loss, so hitting is necessary despite the bust risk. World-Belief
    is The dealer's visible card (6) and hidden card sum to a total they must hit
    until reaching 27+. Their hidden card could create a low total (e.g., 6+2=8),
    forcing multiple hits and potential busting. However, they might also already
    have a high total (e.g., 6+10=16) and safely reach 27-31. My action is Hit.
