- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 14, which is low. Hitting risks busting but
    offers a chance to reach 17-31. As an aggressive player, taking this risk aligns
    with high-reward goals}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card (10) and hidden
    card sum to 12-21. They must hit until reaching 27+, which often leads to 27-31
    but risks busting. Their higher initial totals reduce bust likelihood}. My action
    is {Hit}.
