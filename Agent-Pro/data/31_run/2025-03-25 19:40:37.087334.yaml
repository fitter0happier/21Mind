    31. Hitting improves my total to 19-28, increasing chances to beat the dealer's
    potential 27+}. World-Belief is {Dealer must hit until reaching 27+. Their hidden
    card could range widely, but their strategy risks busting, especially if their
    starting total is low. However, if their hidden card is high (e.g., 10 or Ace),
    they might reach 27+ safely}. My action is Hit.
