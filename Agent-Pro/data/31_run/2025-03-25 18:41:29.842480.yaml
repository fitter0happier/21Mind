- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 19. Hitting once cannot bust me (max
    total 29) and gives a chance to reach a higher value (20-29) to beat the dealer's
    minimum 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 10. Their hidden card (1-10)
    gives them an initial total of 11-20. They must hit until reaching 27+, risking
    busting but likely achieving 27-31}. My action is Hit.
