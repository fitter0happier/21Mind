- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 15. Hitting can only add up to 25 safely,
    which is still below the dealer’s minimum target of 27. Aggressive play favors
    maximizing my total despite the low odds}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s visible 7
    and hidden card sum to 8-17. They must hit until reaching 27+, risking busting.
    Their final total will likely be 27-31 or bust}. My action is {Hit}.
