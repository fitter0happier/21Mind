- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 18 (8+10). To win, I need to reach
    a higher total than the dealer, who must hit until 27+. Standing at 18 is unlikely
    to win unless the dealer busts, which is rare. Hitting once cannot bust me (max
    card 11 gives 29) and might improve my hand to 19-29.}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible card is 8. Their hidden card could be 2-11, making their initial total
    10-19. They will hit until reaching 27+, likely ending at 27-31. If their total
    is 27, I need at least 28 to win.}. My action is {Hit}.
