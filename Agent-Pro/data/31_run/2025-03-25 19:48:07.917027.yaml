    to win, I need to increase my total closer to 31, and hitting is safe since I
    cannot bust with one card}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible card is 7, and
    they must hit until reaching at least 27. The dealer likely has a starting total
    between 8-17 and will reach 27+ without busting}. My action is Hit.
