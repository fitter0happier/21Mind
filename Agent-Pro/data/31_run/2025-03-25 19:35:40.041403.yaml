    must increase my total while avoiding busting. Aggressive play favors hitting
    to reach a higher total, as standing leaves me vulnerable if the dealer doesn't
    bust}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 4. Their hidden card is likely
    low (1-9), forcing them to hit until they bust. If hidden card is 10, they might
    reach 27-31, but risk busting during hits}. My action is {Hit}.
