    a competitive total, as standing now guarantees a loss unless the dealer busts.
    Aggressive play favors taking calculated risks to maximize potential gains}. World-Belief
    is {The dealer's visible card is 8, and their hidden card could make their total
    range from 9 to 18. They must hit until reaching 27+, which increases their risk
    of busting but also raises their potential total. Their final hand is likely 27-31
    or a bust}. My action is {Hit}.
