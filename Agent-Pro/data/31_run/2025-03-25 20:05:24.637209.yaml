- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 27. Hitting risks a 69% chance to bust but
    offers a 31% chance to reach 28-31. Aggressive play favors high-risk, high-reward}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 6 and hidden card likely result in a low total
    (e.g., 16 if hidden is 10), forcing them to hit multiple times with high bust
    risk. However, they might reach 27-31 safely}. My action is Hit.
