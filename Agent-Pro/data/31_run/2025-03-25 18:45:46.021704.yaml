    drawing a card over 2, which would bust me. Standing gives a high chance to win
    unless dealer reaches 30/31}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 6 and hidden card
    likely total below 27, forcing them to hit multiple times. High risk of dealer
    busting or landing between 27-29, which I beat}. My action is {Stand}.
