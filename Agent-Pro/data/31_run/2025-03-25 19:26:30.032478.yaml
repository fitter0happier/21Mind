- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 19 (9 + 10). Hitting once can safely
    raise my total up to 29, which is closer to 31 and likely beats the dealer's potential
    totals}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 6, and hidden card ranges 1-10.
    Their total is 7-16. They must hit until 27+, risking busting. With a low starting
    total, dealer has a high chance of busting or reaching 27-30, which my 19 may
    lose to}. My action is Hit.
