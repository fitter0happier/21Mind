- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 12, which is very low. To reach a competitive
    total near 31, I must take risks by hitting, as standing leaves me with almost
    no chance to beat the dealer’s likely high total}. World-Belief is {The dealer’s
    visible card is 10, and their hidden card is unknown. They must hit until reaching
    27+, which increases their risk of busting but could also result in a high total
    (27-31) that easily beats my 12 if I stand}. My action is Hit.
