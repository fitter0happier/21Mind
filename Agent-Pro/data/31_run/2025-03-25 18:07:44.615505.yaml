- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 17. As an aggressive player, I must
    hit to increase my total closer to 31, as standing at 17 guarantees a loss against
    the dealer's minimum target of 27}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible card
    is 9, and their hidden card could range from 2-11. They will hit until reaching
    27+, risking a bust if their total is low. Their likely final total will be 27-31}.
    My action is Hit.
