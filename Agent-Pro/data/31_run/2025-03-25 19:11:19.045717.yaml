- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 20, which is low. Hitting can safely improve
    my total up to 31 without busting, maximizing my chance to beat the dealer}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's visible Ace (11) plus hidden card gives them a starting total of
    12-21. They must hit until reaching 27+, risking busting but potentially reaching
    27-31}. My action is Hit.

    As an aggressive player, aiming for 31 maximizes potential reward despite high
    risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Ace (11) likely pairs with a high hidden
    card (6-10/J/Q/K/A), allowing them to reach 27+ safely. Standing at 25 likely
    loses unless dealer busts after multiple hits}. My action is {Hit}.
