- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 13, which is very low. To win, I need
    to increase my total to at least 27 while avoiding busting. Aggressive play favors
    hitting to improve my hand despite the risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    card is 8, and their hidden card could range from 1-10. The dealer must hit until
    reaching 27+, which may force them to bust if their hidden card is low (4-7),
    but they likely reach 27+ if their hidden card is high}. My action is {Hit}.
