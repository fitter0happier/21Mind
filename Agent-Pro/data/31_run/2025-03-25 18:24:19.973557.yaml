- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 17, which is low and unlikely to beat
    the dealer's potential 27+. To maximize my chances, I must hit to aim for a higher
    total closer to 31, as standing now guarantees a probable loss}. World-Belief
    is {The dealer's visible Ace (11) and hidden card likely give a starting total
    below 27, forcing them to hit multiple times. This increases their bust risk,
    but if they reach 27+, they will beat my 17}. My action is {Hit}.
