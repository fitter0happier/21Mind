- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 21 (J as 10 + A as 11). Hitting once
    can't bust me (max total 31) and improves my chance to surpass the dealer's minimum
    of 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's hidden card + 3 requires them to hit until 27+,
    likely reaching 27-31 but risking busting. Their current total is low (4-13),
    forcing aggressive draws}. My action is {Hit}.
