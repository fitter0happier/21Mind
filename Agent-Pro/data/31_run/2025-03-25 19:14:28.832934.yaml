- content: Self-Belief is {I have 14 and need to hit to reach a higher total, as standing
    now almost guarantees loss. Aggressive play favors risking a bust for a chance
    to beat dealer's likely 27+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's hidden card plus 10 will
    likely lead them to hit until reaching 27-31, making their total higher than 14.
    Their bust chance exists but is uncertain}. My action is {Hit}.
