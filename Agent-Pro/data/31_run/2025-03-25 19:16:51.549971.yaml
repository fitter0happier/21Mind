- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 14, which is too low to win unless the dealer
    busts. I must hit to increase my total, as there is no risk of busting with one
    more card}. World-Belief is {The dealer’s visible card is 10, and they must hit
    until reaching 27+. Their hidden card likely puts their current total between
    11-20, forcing them to take multiple cards and risk busting, but they might still
    reach a high total}. My action is Hit.
