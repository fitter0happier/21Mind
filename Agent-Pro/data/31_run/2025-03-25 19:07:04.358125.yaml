- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 18. Hitting once can increase my total
    to 19-28, which might beat the dealer's potential 27. Standing at 18 is risky
    as it likely loses unless the dealer busts.}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    card is 10. Their hidden card (1-10) gives a total of 11-20. They must hit until
    reaching 27+, risking busting if they draw multiple high cards.}. My action is
    {Hit}.
