- content: Self-Belief is {I have 18 points (K=10 + 8). Hitting once cannot make me
    bust (max 28), and reaching a higher total increases my chance to beat the dealer's
    27+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 2 + hidden card likely gives a low total
    (e.g., 2+10=12), forcing them to hit aggressively to 27+, risking busting. However,
    if they reach 27-28, my 18 would lose, but a higher total (e.g., 28) would beat
    27}. My action is {Hit}.
