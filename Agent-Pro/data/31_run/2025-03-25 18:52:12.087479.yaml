- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 15, which is too low to confidently
    beat the dealer. Hitting once cannot bust me (max 25) and is necessary to compete
    against the dealer's potential high total}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible
    card is 8, and their hidden card could create a starting total (8+X) that forces
    them to hit until reaching 27+, risking a bust but likely ending near 27-31}.
    My action is {Hit}.
