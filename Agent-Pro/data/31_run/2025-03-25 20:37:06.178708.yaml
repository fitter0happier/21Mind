- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 19. Hitting once cannot make me bust,
    and I can reach up to 29, which might beat the dealer if they have 27-28. Standing
    at 19 guarantees a loss since the dealer must reach at least 27.}. World-Belief
    is {The dealer's hidden card plus 9 must sum to 10-19. They will hit until reaching
    27-31. If their total is 27-31, they stand, which is higher than my 19 if I stand.}.
    My action is Hit.
