- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 13, which is low. As an aggressive
    player, I must hit to increase my total toward 31, as standing with 13 is almost
    certain loss unless the dealer busts. Hitting now carries no immediate bust risk}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 5 and hidden card sum to 6-15. They will hit
    until reaching 27+, risking busting. Their final total will likely be 27-31 or
    bust}. My action is Hit.
