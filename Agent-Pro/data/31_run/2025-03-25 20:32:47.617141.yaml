- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 20, which is low. Hitting once is safe
    (cannot exceed 31) and gives me a chance to reach 21-31, improving my position
    against the dealer}. World-Belief is {The dealer must hit until reaching 27+,
    likely ending between 27-31. If I stand at 20, the dealer’s probable total (27+)
    will beat me unless they bust, which is uncertain}. My action is {Hit}.
