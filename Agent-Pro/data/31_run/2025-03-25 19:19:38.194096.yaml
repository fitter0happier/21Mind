    is no risk of busting. Hitting improves my total, potentially up to 28, which
    can beat the dealer if they land on 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card
    is 10, and their hidden card (1-10) gives a starting total of 11-20. They must
    hit until reaching 27+, risking busting. Higher starting totals reduce their required
