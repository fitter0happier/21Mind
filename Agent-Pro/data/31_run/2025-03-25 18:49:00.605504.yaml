- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 30, close to 31. Hitting risks an immediate
    bust unless I draw an Ace (1). Standing risks dealer reaching 30/31, but likely
    forces them to bust or stay below 30}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Ace (1
    or 11) and hidden card likely total below 27, requiring multiple hits with high
    bust probability. Dealer may struggle to reach 30/31 safely}. My action is {Stand}.
