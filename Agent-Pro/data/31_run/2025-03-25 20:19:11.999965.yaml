- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 19, which is low relative to 31. Hitting once
    cannot bust me (max 30) and improves my chance to beat the dealer}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's visible card is 4; their hidden card likely gives a low total (e.g.,
    4+X <27), forcing them to hit multiple times with high bust risk}. My action is
    Hit.
