    I need to increase my total closer to 31 without busting. Aggressive strategy
    favors hitting to aim for higher points.}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card
    is 5, and they must hit until reaching at least 27. Their hidden card could be
    low, forcing multiple hits and increasing bust risk, or high, allowing them to
