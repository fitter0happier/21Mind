- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 17 (A=11 + 6). Hitting could push my
    total closer to 31 (max 27) but risks busting. Standing at 17 guarantees a loss
    since the dealer will reach at least 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s visible card
    is 10. Their hidden card could range from 1-10. To reach 27, the dealer will likely
    take multiple cards, increasing their bust risk if their initial total is low}.
