- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 13, which is very low. As an aggressive player,
    I need to increase my total closer to 31 without busting. Hitting once is safe
    (max total 23) and aligns with risk-taking}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    card is 6, and their hidden card ranges from 1-10. The dealer must hit until reaching
    27+, risking busting if their starting total is low. Their final total will likely
    be 27-31 or bust}. My action is Hit.
