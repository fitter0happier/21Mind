    busts. Hitting once poses no risk of busting and increases my total closer to
    31}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 4, and they must hit until reaching
    ≥27. Their hidden card could make their initial total low, increasing the chance
    they bust while chasing 27}. My action is {Hit}.
