- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 19. Hitting once cannot exceed 31 (max 30),
    so it's safe. Aggressive play favors increasing my total closer to 31}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's hidden card could be low (high bust chance) or high (likely reaching
    27+). Standing risks losing if dealer avoids busting}. My action is {Hit}.
