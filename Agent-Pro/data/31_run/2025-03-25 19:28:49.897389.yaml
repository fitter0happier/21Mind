- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 21 (10+A as 11). Hitting once cannot
    exceed 31, so there's no risk of busting, and I can increase my total up to 31}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's total is 6 + hidden card. They must hit until reaching
    27+, risking busting. Standing at 21 likely loses if dealer reaches 27+}. My action
    is Hit.
