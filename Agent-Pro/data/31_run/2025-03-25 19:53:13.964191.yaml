- content: Self-Belief is {I have 20 (Q+J as 10 each). To reach near 31, I need 11
    more. Hitting risks busting if I draw 10+ but could reach 30/31 with 10/Ace}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's 3 + hidden card likely totals <27, forcing them to hit.
    They might bust or land 27-31}. My action is {Hit}.
