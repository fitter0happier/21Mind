- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 13. To win, need to reach closer to 31
    than the dealer. Aggressive strategy favors hitting to improve hand, but no risk
    of busting with one hit}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 9. Hidden
    card likely results in initial total 10-19. Dealer must hit until ≥27, risking
    bust if forced to take multiple hits (e.g., hidden 7 leading to total 16 → possible
    bust on second hit)}. My action is {Hit}.
