- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 9. To beat the dealer, I must aggressively
    Hit to reach a value closer to 31, as standing at 9 guarantees a loss against
    the dealer's likely 27+ total}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 7. Their
    hidden card and subsequent hits aim to reach ≥27. Even with a low hidden card
    (e.g., 10 for 17 total), they will keep hitting, risking busting but likely ending
    near 27-31}. My action is Hit.
