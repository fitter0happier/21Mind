- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 20, which is far from 31. Hitting once
    cannot bust me since the maximum card value (Ace as 11) would make 31, allowing
    me to improve my hand safely.}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible card is
    10, and their hidden card could make their total 12-21. They must hit until reaching
    27, risking busting but potentially ending with 27-31.}. My action is {Hit}.
