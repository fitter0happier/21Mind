    total to 21-31 (Ace counts as 11), allowing me to potentially beat the dealer
    if they have 27-29}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 10. Their hidden
    card could range from 2-10 or Ace, requiring them to hit until reaching 27+. They
    risk busting if their initial total is low, but will likely land between 27-31}.
