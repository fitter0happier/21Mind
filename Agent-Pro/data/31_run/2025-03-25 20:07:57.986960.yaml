- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 17. Hitting once cannot exceed 31 and
    could improve my total to 27-28, which is closer to 31 and more likely to beat
    the dealer}. World-Belief is {The dealer must hit until reaching 27+. Their visible
    card (2) and hidden card likely give a low total, forcing them to take multiple
    risky hits, increasing their chance of busting}. My action is {Hit}.
