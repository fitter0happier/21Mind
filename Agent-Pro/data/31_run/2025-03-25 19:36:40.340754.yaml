    of winning, I need to increase my total significantly. Even a high Hit (e.g.,
    10) would only bring me to 19, but as an aggressive player, I must take risks
    to reach higher totals.}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible card is 8, and
    they must hit until reaching 27. Their hidden card could be low, forcing them
    to take multiple cards and risk busting. However, their minimum total after hitting
    is 27, so my only win condition is if they bust.}. My action is Hit.
