- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 14, which is low. As an aggressive
    player, I should take the safe opportunity to improve my hand by hitting once,
    as it cannot bust me (max +10 â†’ 24) and aligns with my risk-taking strategy}.
    World-Belief is {The dealer's visible 9 and hidden card likely give them a total
    below 27, forcing them to hit multiple times, which increases their bust risk.
    However, if they reach 27+, my total must be higher to win, which is unlikely
    unless I hit}. My action is {Hit}.
