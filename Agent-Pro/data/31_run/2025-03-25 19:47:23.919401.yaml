- content: Self-Belief is My total is 26. Hitting risks a 6+ card (bust), but a 1-5
    card improves my total (27-31). Aggressive play favors risking a hit for higher
    returns. World-Belief is Dealer's visible 10 + hidden card. They must hit until
    ≥27. Their current total is likely 10 + X (X=2-10/A). They risk busting if X is
    low, needing multiple hits. My action is Hit.
