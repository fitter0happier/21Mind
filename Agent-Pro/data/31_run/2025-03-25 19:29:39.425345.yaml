- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 18. Hitting once cannot bust me, and a higher
    total (up to 28 or 29 with Ace) increases my chance to beat the dealer's minimum
    target of 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's current total is 5 + hidden card. They
    must hit until reaching 27+, risking busting, but their hidden card could be high
    (e.g., 10/Ace), making their target achievable with fewer hits}. My action is
    Hit.
