- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 21 (Q=10 + A=11). Hitting once cannot
    bust me, as even an Ace drawn can be counted as 1 (total 22), and a 10-value card
    brings me to 31, maximizing my chance to beat the dealer. Standing at 21 guarantees
    a loss, as the dealer will reach ≥27.}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card
    is 4. Their hidden card could be any value. They must hit until reaching ≥27,
    risking busting. If their current total is low (e.g., 4 + 10 = 14), they will
    need multiple hits, but their minimum final total is 27.}. My action is {Hit}.
