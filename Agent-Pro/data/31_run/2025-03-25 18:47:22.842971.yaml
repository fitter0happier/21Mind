- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 13, and hitting once is safe (max 23).
    To win, the dealer must bust. Aggressive play favors improving my hand despite
    risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's total is 6 + hidden. They must hit until ≥27.
    Low hidden cards (e.g., ≤5) make dealer likely to bust; high hidden cards (e.g.,
    10) increase bust risk during multiple hits}. My action is Hit.
