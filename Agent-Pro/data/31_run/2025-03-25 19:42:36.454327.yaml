    hidden card makes their starting total 3-12. They will hit until reaching 27+,
    risking a bust}. My action is {Hit}.

    unless I draw an Ace (1), but the chance is low. Standing relies on the dealer
    busting or failing to reach 30}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 2.

    card is low, but could reach 27-31 if hidden card is high (e.g., 9, 10, Ace)}.
