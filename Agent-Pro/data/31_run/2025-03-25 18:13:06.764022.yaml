- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 17, far from 31. Aggressive play requires hitting
    to maximize my total, as hitting once cannot exceed 31 (max +14), giving a chance

    total <27, forcing them to hit multiple times, risking busting. Their high target
    (27+) increases bust probability}. My action is Hit.
