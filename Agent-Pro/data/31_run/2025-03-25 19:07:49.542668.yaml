- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 14. Hitting once adds 1-10, reaching 15-24
    safely. Standing risks losing if dealer doesn't bust, but hitting doesn’t improve
    chances against dealer’s minimum 27.}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s visible card
    is 10. Hidden card ranges 1-10, total 11-20. Dealer must hit until ≥27, risking
    busting. Lower hidden cards increase dealer’s required hits and bust probability.}.
    My action is {Hit}.
