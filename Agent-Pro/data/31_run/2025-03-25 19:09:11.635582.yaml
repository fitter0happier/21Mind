- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 21 (A=11 + Q=10). Hitting once cannot
    exceed 31, allowing me to aim for a higher total (22-31) without busting}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's total is 2 + hidden card. They must hit until reaching 27+, risking
    busting but likely ending near 27-31. Standing at 21 risks losing if the dealer
    reaches 27+}. My action is {Hit}.
