- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 19. Hitting once cannot exceed 31,
    allowing me to increase my total to 20-29. Standing now guarantees a loss as the
    dealer will reach ≥27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's total is 9 + hidden card. They
    must hit until reaching ≥27, risking busting if their initial total is low. Their
    final total will likely be 27-31 or bust}. My action is Hit.
