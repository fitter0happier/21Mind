- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 18. Hitting once cannot exceed 31 (max
    29), so there's no risk of busting. Hitting can improve my total to 19-29, increasing
    chances to beat the dealer}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 7. With
    a hidden card, their total is 9-18. They must hit until reaching 27+, risking
    busting. If they reach 27+, they will likely beat my 18 unless I improve}. My
    action is Hit.

    needing a 1-3 to survive. Standing preserves 28, which may beat the dealer if
    they bust or stop at 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's initial total is 7 + hidden
    card (8-17). They must hit until â‰¥27, risking multiple draws and potential busting.
