- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 14, which is too low to beat the dealer's
    likely 27+ total. Hitting is necessary to increase my score, and since 14 + 10
    = 24 ≤ 31, there is no risk of busting}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card
    is 7, and they must hit until reaching ≥27. Their hidden card could range from
    1-10, but even with a low total, they will keep hitting and likely end up with
    27-31}. My action is {Hit}.
