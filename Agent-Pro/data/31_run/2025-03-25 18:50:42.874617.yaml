    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game. Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 31 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 31, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of losing the game over 3 points. \n4. After all players have\
    \ completed their hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit\
    \ until their cards total 27 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Club 8}.\

- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 14, which is too low to beat the dealer's
    likely 27+ total. Hitting once maxes at 24, still below 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    hidden card + 8 requires them to hit until 27+, likely reaching 27-31 without
    busting}. My action is {Stand}.
