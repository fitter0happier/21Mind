    my hand to 18-28, but only 28 beats the dealer's minimum 27. Standing leaves me
    dependent on the dealer busting}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 4,
    and their hidden card could create a total requiring multiple hits to reach 27.
    They risk busting but might achieve 27+}. My action is Hit.
