- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 19 (9+10). Hitting once cannot exceed
    31 (max +11 Ace = 30), so it's safe and increases my chance to beat the dealer}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's Ace (1 or 11) plus hidden card. They must hit until
    â‰¥27, risking busting. Their hidden card likely forces multiple hits, increasing
    bust risk}. My action is Hit.
