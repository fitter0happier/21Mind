    so I can safely take a card to improve my total, but even the maximum of 26 will
    lose if the dealer reaches 27+}. World-Belief is {Dealer must hit until reaching
    27+. Their hidden card (1-10) plus 7 gives an initial total of 8-17, requiring
    multiple hits, increasing bust risk}. My action is Hit.
