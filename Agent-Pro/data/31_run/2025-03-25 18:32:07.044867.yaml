- content: Self-Belief is {Current total 17. Hitting can add 1-11 points (Ace as 11)
    to reach 18-28, avoiding bust. Aggressive strategy prioritizes maximizing total
    to challenge dealer's minimum 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 + hidden
    card. They must hit until ≥27. Hidden card likely low (needs multiple hits) or
    high (near 17). Risk of dealer reaching 27-31 or busting}. My action is {Hit}.
