- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 20 (Diamond J and Spade J). To maximize
    my chances, I need a higher total close to 31. Hitting once cannot bust me since
    the maximum card (Ace=11) gives 31}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s visible card is
    6. Their hidden card could be 2-11, making their total 8-17. They must hit until
    reaching 27+, risking a bust if their initial total is low}. My action is Hit.
