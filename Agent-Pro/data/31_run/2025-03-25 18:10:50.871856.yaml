- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 23 (7+K+6). Hitting gives a chance
    to reach 24-31, with a 61.5% chance of success (values 1-8) but a 38.5% risk of
    busting (9-10). Aggressive play favors risking a hit to aim higher}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's visible card is 10. Their hidden card is likely high (e.g., 10, 30.77%
    chance), making their initial total 20. Dealer must hit to 27+, likely achieving
    27-30 with low bust risk. Lower hidden cards (e.g., 7) increase dealer’s bust
    chance but are less probable}. My action is Hit.
