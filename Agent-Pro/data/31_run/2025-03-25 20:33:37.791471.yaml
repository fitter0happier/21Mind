- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 19. Hitting once cannot exceed 31 (max
    +12 is impossible; cards max at 10, so 19+10=29), so there is no risk of busting.
    Hitting improves my chances of a higher total closer to 31}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible 3 and hidden card sum to 3+X. They must hit until reaching 27, which is
    highly risky and likely to cause a bust. However, if they reach 27-31, my 19 would
    lose}. My action is Hit.
