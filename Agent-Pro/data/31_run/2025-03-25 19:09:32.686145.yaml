- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 17. Hitting once is safe (max +11 â†’ 28).
    Aggressive strategy favors increasing total closer to 31}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible 2 + hidden card (3-10) likely results in low initial total (5-12). Dealer
    must hit until 27+, risking busting. Standing at 17 risks losing if dealer reaches
    27+}. My action is Hit.
