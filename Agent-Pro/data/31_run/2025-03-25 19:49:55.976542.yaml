    can safely increase my total to 22-31 without busting. To win, I need at least
    28 to potentially beat the dealer's minimum of 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible card is 10 (Q), and hidden card ranges 1-10. Dealer must hit until total

    possible without busting. Hitting would instantly exceed 31, causing a loss}.
