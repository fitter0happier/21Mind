- content: Self-Belief is My current total is 19. To win, I need to hit to increase
    my total closer to 31, as standing guarantees a loss against the dealer's minimum
    27. World-Belief is The dealer's visible card is 8, and they must hit until reaching
    27+. Their hidden card likely keeps them below 27 initially, forcing them to draw
    and risk busting. My action is Hit.
