- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 18, which is low. Hitting can safely
    increase my total (no bust risk) to 19-29, potentially reaching 27-29 to compete
    with the dealer's likely 27+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 and hidden
    card require them to hit until â‰¥27. Their hidden card's value determines their
    initial total, affecting bust probability. Lower hidden cards increase dealer's
    bust chance, but higher cards (e.g., 10) let them reach 27-30 safely}. My action
    is {Hit}.
