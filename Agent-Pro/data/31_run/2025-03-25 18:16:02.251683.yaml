    Ace is 11) or 27 (with a 10), but risks busting if the next card exceeds 14. Standing
    guarantees a loss against dealer's minimum 27}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    Ace (11) and hidden card. They must hit until reaching 27+, likely ending at 27-31
    or busting. Their final total depends on hidden card and subsequent draws}. My
