    hit to increase my total closer to 31 without busting, as standing now almost
    guarantees a loss}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible card is 9. They must
    hit until reaching 27, so their final total will likely be 27 or higher. Their
    hidden card could make their initial total low, forcing them to draw multiple
    cards and risk busting}. My action is Hit.
