- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 20, which is low compared to the dealer's potential
    27+ target. Hitting could push me closer to 31, but risks minimal bust chance
    (max card value 11, 20+11=31 safe)}. World-Belief is {Dealer's total is 3 + hidden
    card. They must hit until reaching 27+, risking busting if their hidden card is
    low and draws high cards repeatedly}. My action is {Hit}.

- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 28 (K+10+8). Hitting risks busting
    (needs ≤3), but could reach 31. Standing leaves me at 28, which is strong but
    beatable if dealer reaches 28-31}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 3.
    Hidden card is unknown, but their total is likely low (3+X). Dealer must hit until
    ≥27, which is highly risky and likely to bust}. My action is Stand.
