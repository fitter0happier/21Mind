- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 21 (K=10 + A=11). Hitting risks a 6.4%
    chance of busting (drawing A) but offers a 93.6% chance to reach 22-31, potentially
    securing a higher total}. World-Belief is {Dealer's total is 10 + X (12-21). They
    must hit until reaching 27+, risking busting. Standing at 21 risks losing if the
    dealer reaches 27-31}. My action is {Hit}.
