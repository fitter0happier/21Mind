- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 11. Hitting gives a high chance to
    reach 21 or a strong hand (e.g., 17-20), but risks busting with high-value cards.
    Aggressive strategy favors maximizing potential reward}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s
    visible 8 suggests their total is likely 16 or higher if hidden card is 8+. They
    must hit until ≥17, increasing bust risk if their total is low}. My action is
    {Hit}.
