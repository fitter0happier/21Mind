- content: Self-Belief is {I have a soft 16 (A+5), which allows flexibility to hit
    without immediate bust risk. Aggressive strategy favors improving the hand to
    compete against the dealer's strong upcard}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    10 suggests a high probability of a strong total (17+). Hidden card likely forces
    dealer to stand, but a low hidden card (6 or below) would require them to hit}.
    My action is {Hit}.
