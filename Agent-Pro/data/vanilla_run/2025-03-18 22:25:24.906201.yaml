    bust as Ace adjusts to 1 if needed, risking lower totals but possibly reaching

    chance; hidden card may leave them below 17, forcing risky draws}. My action is

    \ is {Dealer likely has low total (5 + X), high chance of busting}. My action\
    \ is {Stand}. \n\nWait, I'm confused. Earlier I thought basic strategy says Stand,\
    \ but the user is aggressive. But after careful consideration, the dealer's high\
    \ bust chance makes Stand the better option even for aggressive play. Because\
    \ even though aggressive, the highest return is to let the dealer bust. Therefore,\
    \ the action is Stand. But I need to verify. If the dealer has a 5 and hidden\
    \ card, their total could be from 6 (if hidden Ace) to 15 (if hidden 10). They\
    \ must hit until 17. So if their total is 16, they hit. They have a high chance\
    \ of busting. Therefore, standing on 12 is better, even for aggressive players,\
    \ because the dealer is likely to bust. So the correct action is Stand. \n\nFinal\
    \ answer: \n\nSelf-Belief is {Total 12 (Ace as 1) with potential to improve}.\
    \ World-Belief is {Dealer's 5 and hidden card likely forces them to hit and risk\
    \ busting}. My action is {Stand}. \n\nBut the initial thought process was conflicting.\
    \ However, after considering the dealer's high bust probability, the best aggressive\
    \ move is to Stand, forcing the dealer to play their hand and likely bust. \n\n\
    The final output would be: \n\nSelf-Belief is {Total 12 with Ace counted as 1,\
    \ needing to improve to beat dealer}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 5 and\
    \ hidden card likely requires hitting, increasing bust probability}. My action\
    \ is {Stand}. \n\nBut the user wants aggressive play, which sometimes means taking\
    \ risks, but in this case, the aggressive yet smart play is to let the dealer\
    \ bust. So Stand. \n\nBut the answer would be: \n\nSelf-Belief is {I have a hard\
    \ 12 (Ace as 1) and need a higher total}. World-Belief is {Dealer's 5 upcard and\
    \ hidden card may lead to a bust when hitting to 17}. My action is {Stand}. \n\
    \nYes, that's correct."
