- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 16, which is a weak hand. Standing risks losing
    if the dealer has 17+. Hitting could improve to 17-21 but risks busting with a
    6+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 gives them a high chance of 17+ (if
    hidden card is 7-10 or Ace). They will stand on 17+, making my 16 likely a loss}.
    My action is Hit.
