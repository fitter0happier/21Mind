    offers a chance to improve. Aggressive strategy favors taking risks}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's visible 10 gives them a strong base. Their hidden card likely creates
    a total of 17+ (if 7+) or forces them to hit (if 2-6), risking a bust}. My action
    is Hit.

    immediate bust unless I draw an Ace. Standing maximizes safety while forcing the
    dealer to beat 20}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 10. Their hidden
    card could be 7 or lower (forcing them to hit) or 8-Ace (allowing them to stand).
