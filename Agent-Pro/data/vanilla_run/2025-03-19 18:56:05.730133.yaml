- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 17, which is strong but not guaranteed
    to beat the dealer. Aggressive strategy favors risking a hit to reach 18-21, but
    with high bust chance (73.5%). World-Belief is {Dealer's Ace likely forms a strong
    hand (e.g., hidden 10 for 21) or soft 17, forcing them to hit and possibly bust.}.
    My action is {Hit}.
