- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 18 (A=11+7) or 8 (A=1+7), but optimally
    18. Hitting cannot bust me immediately, as Ace can adjust to 1 if needed. Aggressive
    strategy favors improving to 19-21}. World-Belief is {Dealer's Ace gives them
    a strong starting hand. Their hidden card could be 6-10 (17-21) or lower (forcing
    them to hit and risk busting). They might already have a higher total than 18}.
    My action is Hit.
