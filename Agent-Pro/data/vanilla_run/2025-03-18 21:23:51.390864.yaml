- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 8, which is very low. Hitting is necessary
    to improve my hand, as there's zero risk of busting on the next card (max possible
    total after one Hit is 18).}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible 8 suggests
    a strong potential total (e.g., 16-19 if hidden card is 7-10). They must hit until
    17+, risking busting if their hidden card is low.}. My action is {Hit}.
