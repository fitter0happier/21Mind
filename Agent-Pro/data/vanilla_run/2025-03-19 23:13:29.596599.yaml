    to 1 if needed. Hitting could improve to 18-21 or risk busting, but aggressive
    play favors chasing higher returns}. World-Belief is {Dealer's 7 suggests a potential
    total of 14-17. They must hit until â‰¥17, increasing bust risk but may still beat
    my 17 if they reach 18+}. My action is Hit.
