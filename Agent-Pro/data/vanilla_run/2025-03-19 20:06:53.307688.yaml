    player, hitting offers a high chance to reach a strong hand (e.g., 21 with a 10-value
    card) and outweighs the risk of busting}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 8
    suggests their total is likely 16+ after hitting to 17, making standing at 11
    insufficient to win}. My action is {Hit}.
