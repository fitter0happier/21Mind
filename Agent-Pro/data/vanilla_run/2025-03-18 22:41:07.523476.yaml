- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 13, which is low. Hitting risks busting but
    could improve my hand significantly if I draw 8 or lower. Aggressive strategy
    favors taking calculated risks}. World-Belief is {Dealerâ€™s visible 7 suggests
    a possible total of 14-17 (if hidden card is 7-10). Dealer must hit until reaching
    17, so they might bust if their total is below 17}. My action is {Hit}.
