- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is a soft 13 (Ace as 11 + 2), which allows
    me to safely hit without risk of busting, as the Ace can adjust to 1 if needed}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 2 suggests a low total, requiring them to hit
    until reaching 17, increasing their bust risk but also their chance to improve}.
    My action is Hit.
