- content: Self-Belief is {I have 11 points. Hitting here is optimal because there's
    a high probability of drawing a 10-value card to reach 21 or a strong total, aligning
    with aggressive risk-taking}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible 7 suggests
    their total is likely 14-17. They must hit until reaching 17, increasing their
    chance of busting if their hidden card is low}. My action is {Hit}.
