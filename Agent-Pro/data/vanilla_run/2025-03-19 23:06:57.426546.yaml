- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 9, which is very low. Hitting is necessary
    to improve my hand, as standing would almost guarantee a loss unless the dealer
    busts. Aggressive play favors taking risks to reach a competitive total}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's visible 7 suggests their total is 7 + hidden card. They must hit
    until reaching 17, so their hidden card could lead to a bust if it forces them
    to draw multiple times. However, their current total might already be 17+ if the
    hidden card is 10}. My action is Hit.
