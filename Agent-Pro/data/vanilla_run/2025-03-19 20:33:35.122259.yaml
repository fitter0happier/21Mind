- content: Self-Belief is {I have 15, which is a weak hand. As an aggressive player,
    I prioritize chasing higher returns despite the risk of busting}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer’s visible 9 and hidden card likely give them a strong total (e.g.,
    19 if hidden card is 10). They must hit until reaching 17, but their current hand
    may already be strong}. My action is {Hit}.
