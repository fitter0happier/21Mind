    bust me immediately, as Ace can be counted as 1 to adjust, but risks lowering

    upcard increases chances of strong total (17-21). Hidden card likely 7+ or 10/A,
    making them stand or hit safely}. My action is {Hit}.

    likely to lose against the dealer's potential 17-21. Aggressive play favors risking
    a hit to improve my hand despite high bust chance}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
