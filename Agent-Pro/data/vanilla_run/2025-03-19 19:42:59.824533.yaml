- content: Self-Belief is {Ace (11) + 2 = 13; hitting could improve to 14-21 with
    low-moderate bust risk (e.g., 8+ busts if Ace remains 11, but Ace flexibility
    reduces risk)}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible J (10) + hidden card (X). Dealer's
    total is 10+X, will hit if X ≤ 6 (total ≤16) and stand otherwise. High chance
    dealer finishes 17-20}. My action is {Hit}.
