    chance to avoid busting (A-7) and potentially improve to 15-21, aligning with
    aggressive play}. World-Belief is {Dealer's 2 upcard suggests a high likelihood
    they must hit multiple times, increasing their bust risk. Their hidden card is
    unknown, but their total is likely low}. My action is {Hit}.
