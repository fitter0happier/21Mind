    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game.Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 21 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 21, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of losing the game over 21 points. \n4. After all players have\
    \ completed their hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit\
    \ until their cards total 17 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Spade A}.\
    \ The dealer has another hidden card. You don't know what it is. Your current\
    \ cards are {Club 10,Diamond 6}. Please read the behavoiral guideline and world\
    \ modeling carefully. Then you should analyze your own cards and your strategies\
    \ in Self-belief and then analyze the dealer cards in World-belief. Lastly, please\
    \ select your action from {\"Stand\",\"Hit\"}.### Output Format: Self-Belief is\
    \ {Belief about youself}. World-Belief is {Belief about the dealer}. My action\

- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 16, which is weak. Hitting risks busting, but
    standing almost guarantees loss if the dealer has 17+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    Ace gives flexibility. Their hidden card could make 17+ (e.g., 6+), forcing them
    to stand, or below 17, forcing them to hit. High chance dealerâ€™s total is strong}.
    My action is Hit.
