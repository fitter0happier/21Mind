- content: Self-Belief is {I have 8 points. Hitting is necessary to improve my hand,
    as standing on 8 is too weak to beat most dealer outcomes.}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s
    visible card is 8. Their hidden card could give them a strong total (e.g., 10
    for 18), but they might also have a low card, forcing them to hit and risk busting.}.
    My action is {Hit}.
