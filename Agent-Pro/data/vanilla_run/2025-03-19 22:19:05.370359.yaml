    is {Dealer's visible 10 suggests a strong hand. Their hidden card likely gives
    them 17+ (e.g., 7 or higher), but they could still have a weak total requiring
    a hit}. My action is Hit.

    dealer's potential 17-21. Aggressive play may justify risking a Hit to chase 21,
    but 18 is already competitive}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 and hidden
    card likely give them a total of 17-20, with high probability of 17+ requiring
    no further hits. If hidden card is 2-6, dealer must risk busting}. My action is
