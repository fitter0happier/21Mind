    but offers a chance to improve. As an aggressive player, prioritizing potential
    gains over safety}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Ace and hidden card likely
    form a strong hand (e.g., 17+ with 6 or 10-value card). Dealer might stand or
    have high bust risk if forced to hit}. My action is Hit.
