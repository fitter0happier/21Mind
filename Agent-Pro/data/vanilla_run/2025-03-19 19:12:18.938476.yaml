- content: Self-Belief is {I have 13 points (J+3), which is a weak hand. Aggressive
    strategy favors hitting to aim for 17-21, despite risk of busting}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer's visible 7 suggests they likely need to hit (total <17). Their hidden
    card could be high (e.g., 10/J/Q/K) for 17, but low cards force them to risk busting}.
    My action is {Hit}.
