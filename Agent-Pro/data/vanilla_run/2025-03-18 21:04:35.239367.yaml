- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 16 (soft, Ace as 11) or 6 (Ace as 1).
    Hitting allows adjusting the Ace to 1 if needed, minimizing bust risk while pursuing
    a higher total}. World-Belief is {Dealer's Ace likely forms a strong hand (e.g.,
    21 with a 10-value hidden card), but they might have to hit if their total is
    below 17}. My action is Hit.

    I count the Ace as 1, making 13. Hitting could improve my hand but risks busting.
