    chance to improve but risks busting. Aggressive play prioritizes chasing higher
    totals despite risks.}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 8 suggests a strong
    potential total (likely 16-19). They must hit until reaching 17+, making their
    hand likely to beat 12 if I stand.}. My action is {Hit}.
