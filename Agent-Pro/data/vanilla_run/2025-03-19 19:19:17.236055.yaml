    to aim for 17-21, accepting bust risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's 3 suggests a
    weak total; they might bust if forced to hit, but their hidden card could create
    a stronger hand}. My action is Hit.

    probability of busting (69.2% chance), but standing gives a solid chance to win
    if the dealer fails to reach 20+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 3 indicates
    a likely low total. They must hit until reaching 17, increasing their bust risk,
