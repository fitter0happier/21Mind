    stands on ≥17, risks busting if hidden card is ≤6}. My action is Hit.

- content: Self-Belief is {I have 20, which is very strong. Hitting risks an immediate
    bust (only an Ace would save me, but it’s unlikely). Standing maximizes my chance
    to win unless the dealer has 20/21}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s visible card is
    10. Their hidden card could be 7 (total 17), making them stand, or lower (forcing
    them to hit and risk busting). They could also have 10/Ace (total 20/21), but
    that’s less probable}. My action is {Stand}.
