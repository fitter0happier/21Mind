- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 9. Hitting is necessary to aim for
    a competitive hand (e.g., 19 with a 10), as standing on 9 is too weak to beat
    most dealer outcomes}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s visible 5 suggests a likely total
    of 12-15 (with a hidden 7-10), forcing them to hit and risk busting. However,
    their final hand could still exceed my 9 if I stand}. My action is Hit.
