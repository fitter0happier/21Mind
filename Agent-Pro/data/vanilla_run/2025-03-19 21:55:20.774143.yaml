- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 19 (Ace as 11) or 9 (Ace as 1), but
    optimally 19. As an aggressive player, I can risk hitting to reach 20-21, leveraging
    the Ace's flexibility to avoid busting}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card
    is 10; their hidden card has a high chance (4/13) of being 7-10, giving them 17-20,
    but they might also need to hit if it's 6 or lower}. My action is Hit.
