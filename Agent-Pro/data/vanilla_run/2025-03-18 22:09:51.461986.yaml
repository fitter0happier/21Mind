- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 8. Hitting gives me a chance to reach
    a strong hand (e.g., 18 with a 10) with low immediate bust risk. Standing now
    guarantees a weak hand, likely losing unless the dealer busts.}. World-Belief
    is {Dealer’s visible 6 plus hidden card. They must hit until ≥17. If hidden card
    is 10, dealer has 16 and will hit, risking bust. If hidden card is 7-10, dealer
    has 13-16 and will hit.}. My action is Hit.
