- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 8, which is very low. As an aggressive player,
    I must take risks to improve my hand. Hitting gives a high chance of increasing
    my total without immediate bust risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Ace (11)
    and hidden card. Their total could range widely (12-21). If hidden card is ≤6,
    dealer will hit, risking bust; if ≥7, they stand with 17+}. My action is Hit.
