- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 13, and as an aggressive player, I prioritize
    improving my hand despite the risk of busting. The probability of drawing a safe
    card (Ace-8, 32/48) is higher than busting (16/48), making hitting favorable}.
    World-Belief is {The dealerâ€™s visible 8 suggests a strong hand (likely 16-19).
    They must hit until reaching 17+, so their hidden card likely forces them to stand
    (e.g., 9/10/J/Q/K) or risk busting if low}. My action is Hit.
