- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 4, which is very low. To beat the dealer, I
    must improve my hand aggressively, as standing now guarantees a loss unless the
    dealer busts. Hitting is necessary despite risks}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    card is 3. Their hidden card could give them a total between 4 (if hidden card
    is Ace) and 20 (if hidden card is 10). They must hit until reaching 17, so they
    might bust if their total is low}. My action is {Hit}.
