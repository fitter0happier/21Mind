- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 13 (Ace as 11 + 2) or 3 (Ace as 1 +
    2), but I can leverage the Ace's flexibility to hit and aim for a stronger hand
    without immediate bust risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 4 suggests a likely
    weak total (e.g., 4 + 10 = 14), forcing them to hit and risk busting, but they
    could also have a strong hidden card (e.g., 7 for 21)}. My action is Hit.
