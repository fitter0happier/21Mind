- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 15 (A=11 + 4) or 5 (A=1 + 4). Hitting
    could improve to 17-21 or drop to 12-16, but aggressive play prioritizes chasing
    higher totals despite bust risk.}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 10.
    Their hidden card has an 8/13 chance to give them 17+ (stand) and 5/13 chance
    to force them to hit on 16 (potential bust).}. My action is Hit.
