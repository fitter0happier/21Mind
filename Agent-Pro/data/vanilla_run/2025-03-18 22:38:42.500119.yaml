    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game.Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 21 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 21, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of losing the game over 21 points. \n4. After all players have\
    \ completed their hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit\
    \ until their cards total 17 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Heart 9}.\

- content: Self-Belief is {I have 18, which is strong but not guaranteed to beat the
    dealer. As an aggressive player, I may risk hitting to aim for 19-21 despite the
    high bust chance}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 9 suggests their total could
    be 17-19. If their hidden card is ≤8, they might hit and risk busting, but a 10-value
    card gives them 19, beating my 18}. My action is {Hit}.
