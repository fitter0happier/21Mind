- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 15, which is low. Hitting risks busting but
    could improve my hand. Aggressive play favors taking calculated risks to reach
    a competitive total}. World-Belief is {Dealer's Ace gives them flexibility. Their
    hidden card might create a strong total (e.g., 10-value card for 21), but they
    could also have a weak hand (e.g., 6 for 17 or lower, forcing them to hit and
    risk busting)}. My action is Hit.

    Aggressive strategy tempts hitting, but high bust chance}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    Ace likely gives a strong hand (e.g., 21 if hidden card is 10) or forces them
    to hit on low totals, risking bust}. My action is {Stand}.
