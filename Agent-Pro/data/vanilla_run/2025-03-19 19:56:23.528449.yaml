- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 16. Hitting risks busting but offers a
    chance to reach 17-21. Standing leaves a low total likely below the dealer's final
    hand. Aggressive strategy favors taking risks}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    card is 10. Hidden card has a high probability (7/13) of giving them 17-21 (if
    7-10 or Ace), forcing them to stand. If hidden card is 2-6 (5/13 chance), dealer
    must hit but may still improve or bust}. My action is {Hit}.
