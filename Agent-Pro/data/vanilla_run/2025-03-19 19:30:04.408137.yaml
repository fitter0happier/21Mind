- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 9, which is very low. Hitting poses no
    risk of busting and can improve the hand to a competitive total (11-20). Aggressive
    strategy favors maximizing potential gains}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    10 suggests a strong base. Hidden card (2-9 or 10) likely results in a total of
    12-20. Dealer must hit on ≤16, risking bust, but standing on ≥17.}. My action
    is Hit.
