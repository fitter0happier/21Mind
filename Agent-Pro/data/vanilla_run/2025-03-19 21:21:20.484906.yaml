- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 6, which is very low. I need to improve
    my hand aggressively to have a chance to beat the dealer}. World-Belief is {The
    dealer's visible card (Heart Q) gives them a strong starting value of 10. Their
    hidden card could range from 2-10 or Ace, making their likely total 12-20. They
    will hit until reaching 17+, so they might bust if their hidden card is low}.
    My action is Hit.
