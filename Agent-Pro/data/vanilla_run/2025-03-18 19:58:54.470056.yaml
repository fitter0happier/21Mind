    hitting to aim for a higher total (e.g., 19 with a 10-value card) without risk
    of busting}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 7 and hidden card. If their total
    is <17, they must hit, risking busting; possible hidden cards (e.g., 10) could
    give them 17, making them stand}. My action is {Hit}.
