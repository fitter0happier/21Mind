    could improve my hand but carries a high bust risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible card is 2, and their hidden card likely results in a low total (e.g.,
    12 if hidden is 10). They must hit until reaching 17, increasing their bust chance
    but also the risk of them forming a stronger hand}. My action is {Hit}.
