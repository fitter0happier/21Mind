- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 14, which is low. Hitting risks busting but
    offers a chance to improve toward 21. Aggressive strategy favors taking calculated
    risks}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Ace gives them flexibility (11 or 1).
    Their hidden card could create a strong hand (e.g., 10-value card for 21) or force
    them to hit (e.g., total ≤16). They might bust if forced to draw}. My action is
    {Hit}.
