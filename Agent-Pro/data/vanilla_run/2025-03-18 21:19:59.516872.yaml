    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game.Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 21 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 21, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of losing the game over 21 points. \n4. After all players have\
    \ completed their hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit\
    \ until their cards total 17 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Diamond\
    \ 3}. The dealer has another hidden card. You don't know what it is. Your current\
    \ cards are {Heart 4,Club J}. Please read the behavoiral guideline and world modeling\
    \ carefully. Then you should analyze your own cards and your strategies in Self-belief\
    \ and then analyze the dealer cards in World-belief. Lastly, please select your\
    \ action from {\"Stand\",\"Hit\"}.### Output Format: Self-Belief is {Belief about\

- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 14. As an aggressive player, I prioritize improving
    my hand despite the risk of busting. Hitting gives a chance to reach 15-21, but
    a 7+ card will bust me}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 3 suggests a weak total
    (likely 13-16 with hidden card). They must hit until 17, increasing their bust
    risk, but standing at 14 risks losing if they reach 17+}. My action is Hit.
