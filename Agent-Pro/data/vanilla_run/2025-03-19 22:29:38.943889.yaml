    \ and win the game.Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 21 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 21, he or she loses the game.\

    bust (≈92.3% chance), but standing gives a high chance to win unless dealer has
    20/21}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s visible card is 10. Hidden card is likely low
    (needs ≥7 to stand). If hidden card <7, dealer must hit and risks busting. High
    chance dealer’s total is 17-19 or busts}. My action is {Stand}.
