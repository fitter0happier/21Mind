    potential strong hand (17+ if hidden card is 7+), forcing me to aim higher}. My
    action is Hit.

    risk. Hitting risks exceeding 21 with high probability due to 10-value cards}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Q (10) + hidden card. Dealer must hit until
    â‰¥17. Hidden card could be low (risk of dealer busting) or high (e.g., 10/A, giving
    20/21)}. My action is {Stand}.
