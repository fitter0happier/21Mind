    "soft" hand. Hitting cannot immediately bust me, as I can adjust the Ace to 1
    if needed, giving me a chance to improve to 16-21}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible 7 suggests a strong starting hand. Their hidden card could be a 10-value
    (total 17) or lower. They must hit until reaching 17, increasing their bust risk
    if their total is below 17}. My action is Hit.
