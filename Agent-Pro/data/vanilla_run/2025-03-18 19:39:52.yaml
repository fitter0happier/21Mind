    could improve to 17-21. Standing likely loses unless dealer busts. Aggressive
    play favors risking a hit}. World-Belief is {Dealer's 9 increases their chance
    of having 17+ (e.g., hidden 8, 9, 10, or Ace). If dealerâ€™s total is 16 or lower,
    they must hit, risking busting}. My action is {Hit}.
