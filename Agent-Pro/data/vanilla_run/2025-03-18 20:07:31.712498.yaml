- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 7, which is very low. Hitting is necessary
    to increase my chances of reaching a competitive total. The risk of busting is
    minimal, as even a 10-value card would only bring me to 17}. World-Belief is {The
    dealer's visible card is 3, and their hidden card could range from 2-10 or Ace.
    The dealer must hit until reaching at least 17, creating a moderate risk of them
    busting, but standing on 7 risks losing if the dealer avoids busting}. My action
    is Hit.
