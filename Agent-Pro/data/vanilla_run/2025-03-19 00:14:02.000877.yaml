    of busting (only a 2 would save me). Aggressive play here favors minimizing risk}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 + hidden card. They need 17+ to stand. If
    hidden is 7+, they stand (17-20). If hidden ≤6, they hit, risking bust. They have
    ~40% chance to beat 19 (if hidden is 10/Ace)}. My action is Stand.
