- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 13, which is low. Hitting could improve my
    hand to 14-21 if I draw Ace-8, but busting (22+) with 9 or higher is risky. Aggressive
    strategy favors taking the risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 suggests
    a strong hand (17-21 likely). Standing on 13 would likely lose unless dealer busts}.
