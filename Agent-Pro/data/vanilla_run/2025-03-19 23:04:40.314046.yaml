    \ steps, then stop. The description begins now. You are an aggressive player of\
    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game.Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 21 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 21, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\
    \ to finish. If you choose to Hit, you can continue to take a card, but there\
    \ is also the risk of losing the game over 21 points. \n4. After all players have\
    \ completed their hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit\
    \ until their cards total 17 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Diamond\
    \ 10}. The dealer has another hidden card. You don't know what it is. Your current\
    \ cards are {Heart 9,Spade Q}. Please read the behavoiral guideline and world\
    \ modeling carefully. Then you should analyze your own cards and your strategies\
    \ in Self-belief and then analyze the dealer cards in World-belief. Lastly, please\
    \ select your action from {\"Stand\",\"Hit\"}.### Output Format: Self-Belief is\
    \ {Belief about youself}. World-Belief is {Belief about the dealer}. My action\
    \ is {Your action}. Please output in the given format. Do not write anything else."

- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 19, a strong hand. Aggressive play usually
    risks hitting for higher returns, but 19 is near 21, so hitting risks busting}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 suggests their total is likely 17+ (if hidden
    card is 7-10), but they could have 16 or lower. However, dealers must hit until
    â‰¥17, increasing their bust risk if starting low}. My action is {Stand}.
