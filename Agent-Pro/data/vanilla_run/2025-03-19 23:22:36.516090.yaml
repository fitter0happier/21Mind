- content: Self-Belief is {I have 15, a weak hand. Aggressive strategy favors hitting
    to chase 17+ despite high bust risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Q (10)
    likely pairs with 7+ (total ≥17) but could have 6- (forcing hit with risk of busting)}.
    My action is Hit.

    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 plus hidden card. They must hit until ≥17.
    If their total is 17-19, I win. If they have 20, it's a push; 21, they win. Their
