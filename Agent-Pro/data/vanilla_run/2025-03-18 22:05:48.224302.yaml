- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 7, which is very low. Hitting is necessary
    to improve my hand, and I can safely take at least one card without busting. Aggressive
    play favors risking a hit to chase a competitive total}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    Ace gives them flexibility. Their hidden card likely pushes their total to 17+
    (e.g., 6+), but they might still bust if they hit on a low card. Standing now
    guarantees a loss unless dealer busts}. My action is {Hit}.
