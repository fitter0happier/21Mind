- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 11, a high-risk/high-reward position. Hitting
    could lead to 21 with a 10-value card, while standing leaves a low total unlikely
    to beat the dealer}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Ace gives flexibility (total
    12-21). Their hidden card may force them to hit if total is below 17, risking
    a bust}. My action is Hit.
