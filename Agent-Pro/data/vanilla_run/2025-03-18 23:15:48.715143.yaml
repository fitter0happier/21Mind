- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 16, which is a weak hand. Hitting risks busting
    but offers a chance to improve. Standing likely loses if the dealer has 17+}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible Ace gives flexibility. Their hidden card has
    a high probability of being 10-value (≈30.8%), making their total 21. If not,
    they may hit on soft totals (e.g., 12-16), risking busting}. My action is Hit.
