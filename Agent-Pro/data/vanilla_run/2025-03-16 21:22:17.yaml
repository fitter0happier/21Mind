    Hitting risks lowering my total or maintaining 20, but cannot bust due to Ace
    flexibility}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible King (10) and hidden card. Dealer
    must hit until ≥17. Hidden card is not an Ace (no blackjack check), so their total
    is 12-20. They need ≥17 to stand, but only a 10 as hidden card ties me}. My action
