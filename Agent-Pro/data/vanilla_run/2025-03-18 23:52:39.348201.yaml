- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 12 (Aces counted as 1 and 11). Hitting
    could lead to 21 with a 9 or improve the hand with lower cards, but risks busting
    with a 10/J/Q/K}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 9. Their hidden card
    could create a strong total (e.g., 19 with a 10) or force them to hit (e.g., 16
    with a 7).}. My action is Hit.
