- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 17 (A=11 + 6) with a soft hand, allowing
    flexibility. Aggressive strategy favors improving to beat dealer's potential strong
    hand}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 suggests high total (17-20). Hidden
    card likely 7+ due to high 10-value density, but risk remains if they hit and
    bust}. My action is Hit.
