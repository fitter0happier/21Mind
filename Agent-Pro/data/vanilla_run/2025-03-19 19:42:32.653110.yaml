- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 14 (Ace as 11 + 3), a soft hand that
    allows hitting without immediate bust risk. Hitting could improve my hand to 15-21
    or leave it at 12-14, with a chance to beat the dealer}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible 6 suggests a high bust probability. Their hidden card likely forces them
    to hit (e.g., 6 + 10 = 16), risking a bust, but a hidden Ace (total 17) would
    make them stand}. My action is Hit.
