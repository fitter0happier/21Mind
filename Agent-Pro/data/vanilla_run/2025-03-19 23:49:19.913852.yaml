    hand by hitting, but risks busting if I draw a 5 or higher. Aggressive play favors
    taking calculated risks}. World-Belief is {Dealer's 9 suggests a strong potential
    total (likely 17+ if hidden card is 8 or higher). Their hidden card may force
    them to hit, increasing their bust chance}. My action is Hit.
