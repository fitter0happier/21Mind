    \ blackjack who likes to take risks to earn high returns. Please beat the dealer\
    \ and win the game.Game Rule:\n1. Please try to get your card total to as close\
    \ to 21 as possible, without going over, and still having a higher total than\
    \ the dealer.\n2. If anyone's point total exceeds 21, he or she loses the game.\
    \ \n3. You can only choose one of the following two actions: {\"Stand\", \"Hit\"\
    }. If you choose to Stand, you will stop taking cards and wait for the dealer\

    \ is also the risk of losing the game over 21 points. \n4. After all players have\
    \ completed their hands, the dealer reveals their hidden card. Dealers must hit\
    \ until their cards total 17 or higher.\nThe dealer's current card is {Club K}.\

    probability), but could yield 19-21. Aggressive play favors high risk for higher
    reward}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 suggests a high total (17-20). Hidden
    card likely 7-10, requiring no hit, or 2-6, forcing dealer to risk busting}. My
    action is {Stand}.
