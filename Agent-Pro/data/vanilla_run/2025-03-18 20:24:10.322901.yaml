    14-17. If dealer’s total is below 17, they must hit, risking busting; but if they
    have 17+, they stand}. My action is Hit.

    8.5% chance to reach 21 and a 91.5% chance to bust. Aggressive play prioritizes
    minimizing guaranteed losses over low-probability gains here}. World-Belief is
    {Dealer’ 7 likely gives them a 14-17 total. They must hit below 17, risking a
    bust, but a hidden 10/Ace gives them 17-18, which I still beat with 20}. My action
