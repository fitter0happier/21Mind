- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 13, which is low. Hitting could improve
    my hand to a competitive total (14-21) but risks busting if I draw a 9 or higher}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 9. Their hidden card likely gives them
    a total of 17 or higher (e.g., 9+8=17, 9+10=19), forcing them to stand. Standing
    at 13 would likely lose}. My action is {Hit}.
