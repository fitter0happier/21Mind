- content: Self-Belief is {I have a weak total of 12, which is unlikely to beat the
    dealer unless I improve it. As an aggressive player, taking a risk to Hit and
    aim for a 9 or lower is worth the potential reward}. World-Belief is {The dealer's
    visible 8 suggests a strong starting hand; their hidden card could easily push
    their total to 17+ or force a bust if they draw further}. My action is {Hit}.
