- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 13, which is low. As an aggressive player,
    I need to improve my hand despite the risk of busting}. World-Belief is {Dealer’s
    visible Ace gives them flexibility. Their hidden card could lead to a strong total
    (e.g., 10-value card makes 21), but they might also bust if forced to hit on a
    soft hand}. My action is {Hit}.
