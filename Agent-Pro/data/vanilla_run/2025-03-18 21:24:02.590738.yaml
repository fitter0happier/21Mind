    improving the hand despite bust risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 10 suggests
    a strong potential total (17+ if hidden card is 7+), but they might have to hit
    if hidden card is ≤6}. My action is Hit.

    would cause me to bust, so I must stand}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card
    is 10. If their hidden card gives a total ≥17, they will stand; otherwise, they
    hit. But I already have 21, so only a dealer blackjack (Ace hidden) could tie
    or beat me}. My action is {Stand}.
