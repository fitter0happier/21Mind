- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 17 (Ace as 11 + 6), which is a soft
    hand. Hitting cannot bust me because Ace can convert to 1 if needed, allowing
    me to safely improve my hand}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible card is 10 (K).
    Their hidden card could be 7 or higher (17+ total), making them stand, or lower,
    forcing them to hit and risk busting}. My action is Hit.
