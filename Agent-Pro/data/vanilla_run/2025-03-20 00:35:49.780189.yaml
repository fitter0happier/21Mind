- content: Self-Belief is {Current total is 8. Hitting is necessary to reach a competitive
    total; even a 10-value card would make 18, which is viable. Standing on 8 guarantees
    a likely loss unless dealer busts. Aggressive strategy prioritizes improving hand
    despite risk}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 8 suggests their total is 8 +
    hidden card (≥ 17 if hidden card is 9 or 10). Dealer will stand if total is ≥17,
    reducing their bust risk. Hidden card likely ≥ 9, making dealer's total strong}.
    My action is {Hit}.
