- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 18 (9+6+3). Hitting risks a high chance
    of busting (93.6%) since only a 3 would keep me under 21. Standing preserves a
    strong hand}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 2 and hidden card likely result
    in a low total (3-12), forcing them to hit. They risk busting when drawing, especially
    if their hidden card is 10 (total 12)}. My action is {Stand}.
