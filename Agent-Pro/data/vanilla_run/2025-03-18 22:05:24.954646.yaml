- content: Self-Belief is {I have 16, which is a weak hand. Hitting risks busting
    but offers a chance to improve to 17-21. Standing leaves me vulnerable if the
    dealer reaches 17+}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 2 suggests a low total.
    They must hit until 17, risking busting if their hidden card creates a low total
    (e.g., 12-16). However, they might still reach 17+ safely}. My action is Hit.
