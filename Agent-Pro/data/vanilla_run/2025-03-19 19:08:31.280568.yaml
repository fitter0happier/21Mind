    chasing higher returns despite the risk of busting}. World-Belief is {The dealer's
    Ace gives flexibility (11 or 1), and they likely need to hit to reach ≥17, but
    their hidden card might already put them in a strong position}. My action is Hit.

    it to 19-21 with low probability while risking bust}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible Ace could lead to a high total (e.g., 20 with hidden 9) or force them
    to hit and potentially bust if their total is ≤16}. My action is {Stand}.
