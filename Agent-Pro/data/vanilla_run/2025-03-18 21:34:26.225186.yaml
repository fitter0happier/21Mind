- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 5, which is very low; hitting is necessary
    to improve my hand, as standing now guarantees a weak position with minimal chance
    to beat the dealer}. World-Belief is {The dealer’s visible Ace gives them a strong
    starting hand (potential 21 if hidden card is 10), but they might have a soft
    total (e.g., Ace + low card) and could bust if forced to hit}. My action is Hit.
