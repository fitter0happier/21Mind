    to improve my hand to a strong value (e.g., 19 with a 10), but risks busting if
    I draw multiple times}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible 8 suggests they likely
    have 16-20 total after accounting for hidden card, needing to hit if below 17;
    they might bust if forced to draw}. My action is {Hit}.
