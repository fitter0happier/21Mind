- content: Self-Belief is {My current total is 18 (A=11+7), a strong but vulnerable
    hand. Hitting can't bust me (Ace converts to 1 if needed) and may improve to 19-21}.
    World-Belief is {Dealer's 10 upcard suggests high chance of 17+ (needs 7+ in hidden
    card). If hidden card <7, dealer must hit, risking bust}. My action is {Hit}.
