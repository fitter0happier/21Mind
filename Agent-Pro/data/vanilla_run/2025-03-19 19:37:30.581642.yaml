- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 8, which is very low. Hitting cannot bust me,
    as the maximum possible total after one Hit is 18 (if I draw a 10) or 19 (if I
    draw an Ace). Aggressive strategy favors improving my hand}. World-Belief is {Dealer's
    visible card is 10. Their hidden card could be 7 or higher (17+ total), making
    them likely to stand. If hidden card is 6 or lower, dealer will Hit, risking bust}.
    My action is Hit.
