- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 8, which is very low. To have a chance to beat
    the dealer, I must Hit to increase my points, as standing on 8 guarantees a loss
    unless the dealer busts. Aggressive play prioritizes improving my hand despite
    risks}. World-Belief is {The dealer’ visible card is 6, and they must Hit until
    reaching 17. Their hidden card could create totals like 12–16 (if ≤10) or 17+
    (if Ace/10). A 6 increases their bust probability, but standing on 8 risks losing
    if they reach 17+}. My action is Hit.

- content: Self-Belief is {My total is 15, a weak hand, but hitting risks a 54% chance
    to bust. Aggressive play may favor risking a hit to aim for 17-21, but standing
    leverages the dealer's high bust probability}. World-Belief is {Dealer's visible
    6 suggests a likely low total (e.g., 16 if hidden card is 10), forcing them to
    hit with a ~42% bust chance. Their hidden card could also already total 17 (e.g.,
    Ace), but this is less probable}. My action is {Stand}.
