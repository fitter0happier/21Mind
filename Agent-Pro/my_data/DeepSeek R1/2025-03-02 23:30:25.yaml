- content: Self-Belief is {With a total of 11, hitting is optimal since drawing any
    card (Ace-10) will not bust me. An Ace becomes 1, turning 11 into 12, while a
    10-value card gives 21. Standing risks leaving a weak hand against the dealer's
    potential improvement}. World-Belief is {The dealer's visible 5 indicates a weak
    position. Their hidden card could range from 2-10 or Ace, giving a total of 7-15.
    They must hit until reaching 17+, risking a bust with a low starting total}. My
    action is {Hit}.
